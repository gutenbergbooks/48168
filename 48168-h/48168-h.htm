<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Now that the dread of awful war has passed with
the coming of welcome peace, we can turn our minds
with renewed cheerfulness to the merry side of the
great world’s conflict and enjoy with our boys the
funny things they saw and did and said while “over
there.”</p>

<p>The comedy side of the war has been quickly seen
and readily interpreted by the world’s great writers,
as well as by the very officers and men, in all departments
of the service, who themselves participated
in both the serious and the frivolous affairs of warfare
as developed day by day.</p>

<p>It is the humorous experiences of which these warriors
and writers have told us in speech and print
that we have sought to gather into one volume for
the edification and delectation of a humor-loving
public. Enough and too much has been told of the
horrors of war. To hear the pleasanter side, the
merry doings of our soldiers and their allies, the
victorious hosts of freedom, is a welcome relief to
war-weary hearts, freed now, and forever, from the
dire dread of the awfulness of modern slaughter.</p>

<p>So this collection of funny stories has come into
being; its mission to cheer us all with the merry tales
told by and about our conquering soldiers.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>FUNNY STORIES
TOLD BY THE SOLDIERS</div>


<h2>SECRETARY BAKER TELLS A GOOD ONE</h2>

<p>“The neat and even elegant appearance of the
American soldier isn’t maintained,” said War Secretary
Baker in an address, “without hard work. Yes,
the work is hard, but doesn’t the result more than
justify it?</p>

<p>“On the train the other day a private sat with
his tunic unbuttoned, for the temperature was high.
A sergeant strode up to him and said:</p>

<p>“‘Button up that tunic! Did you never hear of
by-law 217, subsection D? I’m Sergeant Jabez Winterbottom!’</p>

<p>“A gentleman in the seat behind tapped the sergeant
sternly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“‘How dare you issue orders with a pipe in your
mouth?’ he asked. ‘Go home and read paragraph
174, section M, part IX. I am Major Eustace Carroll.’</p>

<p>“Here a gentleman with a drooping white mustache
interposed from the other side of the aisle:</p>

<p>“‘If Major Carroll,’ he said coldly, ‘will consult
by-law 31 of section K, he will learn that to reprimand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a sergeant in the presence of a private is an
offense not lightly to be overlooked.’”</p>


<p>THEN HE GRABBED THE PAIL</p>

<p>A woman, one of the 30,000 British working for
the Y. M. C. A., was assigned to scrub the Eagle hut
floor in London. She had done little manual labor
in her life, but accepted the job without protest and
went down on her knees with a pail of hot water, a
cloth, and a cake of soap. Soon the water in the pail
was black. A man in uniform passed. The woman
looked up and asked if he would mind emptying
the pail and refilling it with clean water.</p>

<p>There was a pause, then his reply:</p>

<p>“Dammit, madam, I’m an officer!”</p>

<p>This time there was no pause, but like a flash the
scrubwoman retorted:</p>

<p>“Dammit, officer, I’m a duchess!”</p>


<p>CALLING THE GENERAL DOWN</p>

<p>When General O’Neill, of Allentown, first went to
Spartanburg, S. C., his train was three hours late.
The negro escort appointed to receive him at the
station had been dismissed. The general walked.
Presently he was accosted by a sentry.</p>

<p>“Who is you?”</p>

<p>“General O’Neill.”</p>

<p>“Well, you cut the buck and go up there to headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to beat de debbil and see my captain and
explain yosself. We’s been waitin’ three hours fer
you.”</p>


<h2>DID SHE SAVE DOC ONE?</h2>

<p>In the field hospital:</p>

<p>Doctor—Save me a sample of everything your
patient takes.</p>

<p>Nurse—He took a kiss this morning.</p>


<h2>WANTED TO KILL THE COOKS</h2>

<p>A young Canadian officer, who had lived for years
in China, was deputed to take to France for service
behind the lines a company of Chinese coolies. On
the ocean voyage over, which was a turbulent one, a
row developed between the coolies and the Cantonese
cooks, and the coolies decided to kill the cooks. Hearing
of it the Canadian called in several of the coolies
and told them if they killed the cooks they would
have nothing to eat until they reached France.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the Canadian of the
coolie ringleader. “Isn’t the food good?” Yes, the
food was good.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there enough food?”</p>

<p>Yes, there was plenty of food.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it well cooked?”</p>

<p>Yes, it was well cooked.</p>

<p>“Well, then, what the devil is the matter? Why
do you want to kill the cooks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” replied the coolie, “we don’t know exactly
why, but somehow or other the food won’t stay
down.”</p>


<h2>YOU CAN’T BEAT THE IRISH</h2>

<p>An elderly Colonel, about to retire, was holding
“officer hours” for the last time and four old offenders
were brought in for punishment.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked them over wearily, and then
said:</p>

<p>“I’ve been listening to the yarns and excuses you
men have concocted for the past three years and I’m
tired of them all. If any of you can think of something
new, I’ll let you off without punishment. If you
can’t, I’ll give you the limit.”</p>

<p>“I took just one drink, and it made me ill, Colonel,”
began the first.</p>

<p>“Old stuff,” said the Colonel.</p>

<p>The second offenders alarm-clock had failed to
work, and the third offender had bad news from home.
There was nothing new in this, and each was given
the limit.</p>

<p>However, the Colonel’s eyes brightened at the approach
of the fourth culprit, an Irishman.</p>

<p>“Be original, Duffy. Tell me something new,”
urged the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Well, Colonel,” Duffy began, with his eyes
a-twinkle, “when Oi heard the sad news that you was
goin’ to l’ave us, it made me so down-hearted that Oi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wint to the nearest public house and drowned me
sorrows.”</p>

<p>“You win!” exploded the Colonel. “Now get
out!”</p>


<h2>ASK SOMEONE FROM MISSOURI</h2>

<p>A long and patient but vain effort on the part of
a khaki-clad driver to induce a mule, drawing what
appeared to be a load of laundry, through the gateway
of a local hospital, afforded considerable amusement
to the doughboys who were watching the proceedings.
The mule would do anything but pass
through the gateway.</p>

<p>“Want any ’elp, chum?” shouted one of the boys
to the driver, as he rested a moment.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the driver, “but I’d like to know
how the devil Noah got two of these blighters into
the Ark!”</p>


<h2>CLARK STREET ENGLISH</h2>

<p>American tourists who are shaky as to their French
have often been embarrassed by the voluble replies
which their carefully studied phrases bring forth
from French lips. Just now the tables are frequently
turned, and the Frenchman or woman is puzzled by
the fluent American vernacular. An example:</p>

<p>Yankee Trooper—“Parly-voo English, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>French Maid—“Yes, a vairl leetle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Yankee Trooper—“Good work! Say, could you
put me wise where I could line up against some good
eats in this burg?”</p>


<h2>HIS MASTER’S VOICE</h2>

<p>Captain (sharply)—“Button up that coat.”</p>

<p>Married Recruit (absently)—“Yes, my dear.”</p>

<h2>WHEN PRESIDENT WILSON LAUGHED</h2>

<p>No doughboy in the charming Champs Elysees
theater, Paris, laughed harder than President Wilson
when the “Argonne players” put all officers on the
gridiron. It was Broadway’s own 77th division that
presented a snappy bill before the dignified peace
commissioners with the exception of Col. House, who
was ill. The play was entitled “Annex Revue, 1918.”</p>

<p>Here are some of the sallies at which Mr. Wilson
laughed:</p>

<p>“If they don’t send me home soon I’ll be so full
of service stripes that I’ll look like a zebra.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind if they miss me over there, just so
the Germans miss me over here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Paris girls—take it from me—they take it from
you. One girl took my identification tag. She
thought it was a franc.”</p>

<p>“By the time you pay your insurance and allotment
you owe yourself money.”</p>

<p>The division’s song, “They Didn’t Think We’d
Do It, but We Did,” will soon be heard on Broadway.</p>


<h2>BEEF, MILK AND BEER</h2>

<p>A cow strayed one day between the German and
the English trenches. Both sides coveted the cow
for its milk and meat, but it was sure death to go
out and get the cow. So the English threw a note
wrapped around a stone into the German trenches:
“You throw a mark in the air, we will shoot at it. If
we hit it, it is our cow. If we miss, we will throw a
shilling in the air. If you hit it, the cow is yours.”
In a few moments a sign was lifted over the German
trenches reading “O. K.,” and a mark shone in the
air. But Tommy missed. Then a shilling flashed
and Fritz missed. Five marks and five shillings
flashed in the air and all were missed. Finally the
sixth mark flashed and Tommy “scored.” Up came
a sign from the German trenches: “Cow is yours,
but we want our marks.” So Tommy went out,
picked up the shillings and marks and carried the
marks over to the German trenches. “Good shot,”
came from a Teuton. “Here is some beer for you,”
and out came six bottles of beer, which Tommy took
over to the English lines—with the cow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<h2>TOO BAD SHE HADN’T MORE SONS</h2>

<p>Two men riding in a street car were talking about
the war. “Well, how much longer do you think this
thing will last?” asked one of the men of his friend.
“Pretty hard to tell,” was the answer. “But as for
me it can go right on for years. I’m making big
money out of it all right.” And he looked it!</p>

<p>A well-dressed middle-aged woman sat next to the
man who had just spoken and, as he finished his
speech, she took off her gloves, stood up and hit the
man a stinging blow across his face. “That is for
my boy in France,” she said; and before he could
recover she hit him another one, and added: “And
that is for my other boy who is about to sail.”</p>

<p>Then she sat down, while the red-faced man looked
about at a carful of people whose approving glances
of the woman’s act led him to feel that he had better
leave the car.—<i>Ladies’ Home Journal.</i></p>


<h2>WHY HE GOT THIRTY DAYS</h2>

<p>Everything was ready for kit inspection; the recruits
stood lined up ready for the officer, and the
officer had his bad temper all complete. He marched
up and down the line, grimly eyeing each man’s
bundle of needles and soft soap, and then he singled
out Private MacTootle as the man who was to receive
his attentions.</p>

<p>“Tooth-brush?” he roared.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Razor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hold-all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm! You’re all right, apparently,” growled the
officer. Then he barked:</p>

<p>“Housewife?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, thank you,” said the recruit amiably.
“How’s yours?”</p>


<h2>TIME TO SWEAR OFF</h2>

<p>A British officer who was inspecting the line in
Flanders came across a raw-looking yeoman.</p>

<p>“What are you here for?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“To report anything unusual, sir.”</p>

<p>“What would you call unusual? What would you
do if you saw five battle cruisers steaming across the
field?”</p>

<p>“Take the pledge, sir.”</p>


<h2>THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIERS</h2>

<p>A negro drill sergeant was addressing a squad of
colored “rookies” under him. He said: “I wants
you niggers to understan’ dat you is to car’y out all
o’ders giben on de risin’ reflection ob de final word
ob comman’. Now when we’s passin’ dat reviewin’
stan’, at de comman’ ‘Eyes Right!’ I wants to hear
ever’ nigger’s eyeballs click.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<h2>NO FOOTSTEPS IN THE AIR</h2>

<p>Dear Old Lady—“I suppose you’ll follow in your
father’s footsteps when you grow up?”</p>

<p>“I can’t; he’s an airman.”</p>


<h2>CHICKEN FEED ON BROADWAY</h2>

<p>The very prosperous-looking gentleman stopped
and permitted the very pretty girl to fasten a carnation
in his buttonhole. Then he handed her a quarter.</p>

<p>“What is this for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You have fed a Belgian baby,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said the other, adding a $5 bill to his
contribution, “you can’t do it. Here, take this, and
buy a regular meal for the baby.”</p>


<h2>THIS WAS IN ENGLAND</h2>

<p>Binks—“Ah, what a loss I have suffered in the
death of my mother-in-law!”</p>

<p>Jinks—“She meant a good deal to you?”</p>

<p>Binks—“Yes; she was a vegetarian, and gave us
her meat-card.”</p>


<h2>VERY LADYLIKE</h2>

<p>This story is from London: A young woman in
khaki uniform and cap met a Scotch kilty. She
saluted. He curtsied.</p>


<h2>HE DROPS INTO POETRY</h2>

<p>Frank Proudfoot Jarvis has been at the Front with
the First Canadian Mounted Rifles for three years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and his sense of humor and the joy of life still survive.
In a letter dated, “Somewhere in Mud, 17th
of Ireland,” he writes to his brother, Paul Jarvis, of
New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class='unindent'>“Dear Old Top:</div>

<p>“I had expected to be in gay (?) Paree on furlough
at this time, swinging down the Boys de
Belogne with girls de Belogne on each arm, but this
is postponed till April. The papers say that von
Hindy has ordered dinner for himself and the Crown
Prince on April Fools’ day, and, if we meet, there
will be a sound of deviltry by night and a Waterloo
that will cause the princelet to wireless his dad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘Of all sad words of tongue or pen,</div>
<div class="verse">The saddest are these, we’re ”soaked“ again.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“However that may be, here I am sitting in a
shed, with a sheepskin over my shoulders, looking
like a lady—but not smelling like one. Fritz is acting
rather nasty, sending us his R. S. V. P.’s by the
air-line, and we reply P. D. Q., and the ‘wake’ is a
howling success as the big bulls and the little terriers
‘barcarole.’ And speaking of wakes, I was awake
myself the other night in my hut and the Gothas
were whirring overhead and Fritz pulling the string
every now and then. It was pitch-dark and a big
Bertha had just shaken all creation, when I overheard
two ‘blimeys’ fanning buckwheat while they
hunted a shell-hole.</p>

<p>“‘Where are yer, Bill?’ asked one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m ’ere,’ says Bill.</p>

<p>“‘Where’s ’ere?’ says his pal.</p>

<p>“‘Ow the blinkin’ ’ell do I know where ’ere is?’
says Bill.</p>

<p>“Just then Fritz put one alongside of my hut and
snuffed out all the candles, but thanks to the good
old soft mud—and how we have cussed that mud!—I
am writing to you, Old Top, tonight. I expect to
be on the hike again in a day or so, I know not where
and I do not care. All places look alike to this old
kid. They can set me down in a field of mud and
inside of forty-eight hours I have got a home fit
for a prince, or a ground-hog—sometimes I am living
several feet under ground and other times I am
living in a tent, a hut, a stable, barn, shed, and,
when in luck, in some deserted chateau.”</p>

<p>Jarvis, lying on his back looking up at a twinkling
star through a hole in the roof seems to have started
a train of verse in his brain, for he writes:</p>

<p>“I got to cogitating about a lot of things, and
for the first time in my life I found rimes running
through what I am pleased to call my mind. So, I
lighted my dip and jotted down the enclosed doggerel.
They say it is a bad sign when a man starts
to write poetry, but I don’t for a moment think anyone
would call this by that name or that I shall even
be acclaimed a <i>Back</i>yard Kipling. Besides, as I
flourish under the sobriquet ‘Bully Beef,’ owing to
my major-general proportions, I am certainly no
Longfellow. But here it is, such as it is:</p>

<h2>THIS PLEASED THE COLONEL</h2>

<p>The sergeant halted the new sentry opposite the
man he was to relieve.</p>

<p>“Give over your orders,” he said.</p>

<p>The old sentry reeled off the routine instructions
with confidence, but one of the special orders baffled
him.</p>

<p>“Come on, man!” said the sergeant impatiently.</p>

<p>“On no account,” stammered the sentry, “are you
to let any questionable character pass the lines, except
the colonel’s wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<h2>DID THE CHAPLAIN SWEAR?</h2>

<p>Recently, during the operations of the British
Egyptian expeditionary force in Palestine, a town
to the south of Beersheba was captured, and in it
was discovered a splendid example of mosaic pavement.</p>

<p>The excavation of it was placed in charge of a
chaplain, and while the work was proceeding some
human bones were discovered.</p>

<p>Elated at the find, the padre immediately wired to
great headquarters, saying:</p>

<p>“Have found the bones of saint.”</p>

<p>Shortly after the reply came back:</p>

<p>“Unable to trace Saint in casualty list. Obtain
particulars of regimental number and regiment from
his identity disk.”</p>


<h2>ONE SWEET KISS LOST</h2>

<p>Before introducing Lieutenant de Tassan, aid to
General Joffre, and Colonel Fabry, the “Blue Devil
of France,” Chairman Spencer, of the St. Louis entertainment
committee, at the M. A. A. breakfast
told this anecdote:</p>

<p>“In Washington Lieutenant de Tassan was approached
by a pretty American girl, who said:</p>

<p>“‘And did you kill a German soldier?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he replied.</p>

<p>“‘With what hand did you do it?’ she inquired.</p>

<p>“‘With this right hand,’ he said.</p>

<p>“And then the pretty American girl seized his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hand and kissed it. Colonel Fabry stood near by.
He strode over and said to Lieutenant de Tassan:</p>

<p>“‘Heavens, man, why didn’t you tell the young
lady you bit him to death?’”</p>


<h2>A COINCIDENCE OF WAR</h2>

<p>The commandant of one of the great French army
supply depots was busy one morning. He was a man
of forty; a colonel in the regular French army. He
was talking to an American colonel when an erect,
sturdy-looking man with white hair and mustache
and who wore the single star of a subaltern on his
sleeve came up, saluted, delivered a message and then
asked:</p>

<p>“Are there any more orders, sir?”</p>

<p>When he was told that there were none he brought
his heels together with a click, saluted again and went
away.</p>

<p>The commandant turned to the American with a
peculiar smile on his face and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know who that man is?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“That is my father,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The father was then exactly seventy-two years
old. He was a retired business man when the war
broke out. After two years of the heroic struggle he
decided that he couldn’t keep out of it. He was too
old to fight, but after long insistence he secured a
commission. By one of the many curious coincidences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of war he was assigned to serve under his
son.</p>

<h2>UNANIMOUS</h2>

<p>We should like to print this story in letters of
gold, says the London Tit-Bits. It is of a colonel on
the British front who wanted twenty men to face
almost certain death.</p>

<p>He called the whole company together and made
the situation clear to them. Then he asked for
twenty volunteers to advance one pace. He loved his
men, and it was almost more than he could bear. He
closed his eyes to keep back his tears, and when he
opened them the men stood in exactly the same formation.
He was pained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there not one volunteer?” he asked.</p>

<p>A sergeant stepped forward at salute. “Every one
has advanced one pace, sir,” he said.</p>


<h2>PA WAS THE GENERAL</h2>

<p>The young subaltern, who was a son of a general
and never omitted to rub in that fact, was taking a
message from the general to the gunners.</p>

<p>“If you please,” he said to the major, “father says
will you move your guns.” The major was in an
irate mood. “Oh!” he rejoined, “and what the blazes
does your mother say?”</p>


<h2>TOUGH ON GOMPERS</h2>

<p>Kerensky kissed Arthur Henderson, the British
labor politician, as the American Labor Mission calls
him, and all England gasped. Kerensky is coming
to this country. He may want to kiss Secretary Wilson
or even President Wilson. This has led an
anonymous poet to suggest that the President put
his greetings into a song, and to furnish him with
the song, as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Salute me only with thy fist,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And don’t attempt to buss me;</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is quite enough to fuss me.</span></div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h2>HAD THE RIGHT DOPE</h2>

<p>The more things the draft officials do to baseball
here the better it flourishes in London, according to
Richard Hatteras, of that thriving community, who
was recently in New York. Mr. Hatteras says the
game is getting a firm hold on every nationality in
the British capital.</p>

<p>“Why, recently,” quoth he, “I saw a game in
which East Indians were playing. One of these approached
the plate at a crucial moment and cried
aloud:</p>

<p>“‘Allah, give thou me strength to make a hit.’</p>

<p>“He struck out.</p>

<p>“The next man up was an Irishman. He spat on
the plate, made faces at the pitcher, and yelled:</p>

<p>“‘You know me, Al!’ He made a home-run.”</p>


<h2>TELL THIS NOT IN BOSTON</h2>

<p>An American boy had his first experience in the
first line of trenches under fire, and an American
woman met him.</p>

<p>“Well, boy,” asked the woman, “what was it like?
Pretty awful experience, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Awful?” grinned the Sammee. “Funniest thing
you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Funny?” echoed the woman, amazed. “Why,
what in the world do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Those beans! Why——” and he went off into a
gale of laughter. “Of course you don’t know. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cook had made an enormous pot of beans for the
boys and, say, they did smell some good. But they
were too hot and so cook put them on the edge of the
trench to cool off. Just then the Germans let go some
shells and one hit that pot square. And it didn’t do
anything to those beans. Honestly, ma’am, it simply
rained beans for an hour!”</p>


<h2>THE MESSAGE WAS SOBER, ANYHOW</h2>

<p>General Sir Henry Rawlinson, Sir Douglas Haig’s
“right-hand man,” is rather fond of relating a story
concerning a major who, sent to inspect an outlying
fort, found the commander intoxicated. He immediately
locked him up; but the bibulous one managed
to escape, and, making his way to the nearest
telegraph office, dispatched the following message to
no less a personage than the colonial secretary:
“Man here, named ——, questions my sobriety. Wire
to avert bloodshed.”</p>


<h2>HE HADN’T FINISHED</h2>

<p>They had brought him in very carefully, the
husky but femininely gentle stretcher bearers, for he
was nothing but a kid after all, with a complexion
like a girl’s and with pathetically pleading eyes. He
was crying in his hospital bed when the correspondent
came across him and stopped to investigate.</p>

<p>“Are you in great pain?” the newspaper man
sympathetically asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad looked into the other’s eyes and nodded
with a choking sob.</p>

<p>“Where does it hurt?” the correspondent pursued.</p>

<p>“It ain’t that,” was the reply; “it’s because they
yanked me out of the scrap when I still had ten rounds
left.”</p>


<h2>THE OOZING OF THE COONS</h2>

<p>Negro Sergeant—“When I say ‘’Bout face!’ you
place de toe of yo’ right foot six inches to de reah
of de heel of yo’ left foot and jus’ ooze aroun’.”</p>


<h2>SHE WAS IN UNIFORM</h2>

<p>First Officer (in spasm of jealousy)—“Who’s the
knock-kneed chap with your sister, old man?”</p>

<p>Second Officer—“My other sister.”</p>


<h2>NO CHALLENGING OUT OF HIS CLASS</h2>

<p>Sergeant (surprising sentry)—“Why didn’t you
challenge that man who just passed?”</p>

<p>Newest Recruit—“Why, that’s Kayo Hogan,
sergeant, and he’s got all o’ ten pounds on me!”</p>


<h2>CALLING HIM SISSY?</h2>

<p>The Fag—“Oh, I’d go to the war quick enough,
but mother wouldn’t like me to; and I’ve never disappointed
her since the day I was born.”</p>

<p>The Snag—“Well, if she was hoping for a
daughter, I’m sure you’ve done your best to console
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h2>HOW DISAPPOINTED HE’LL BE</h2>

<p>Scotch Warrior from Palestine (whose baby is
about to be christened, and who has a bottle of Jordan
water for the purpose)—“Eh, by the way,
meenister, I ha’e brocht this bottle——”</p>

<p>Minister—“No’ the noo, laddie! After the ceremony
I’ll be verra pleased!”</p>


<h2>AMERICAN HUMOR IN FRANCE</h2>

<p>The sense of humor of the American is a joy to
the French, who miss this quality sadly in the English.
A young French woman was conducting two
young American officers around Versailles. When
they got in the park the French girl said: “Do you
know that the French have a pretty saying, ‘The
smaller the ivy leaf, the dearer the love?’ So I want
each one of you to find the tiniest leaf possible and
send it to the one that’s waiting at home.” The men
set out, and the first man came back with a perfectly
enormous leaf, which he told the girl he had plucked
for his mother-in-law! The second officer came back
with a leaf even larger and, when asked what loved
one was to have that tiny leaf, he said: “Why, this is
for the Kaiser!”</p>


<h2>SNOBBERY SQUELCHED</h2>

<p>On seeing the haughty aristocrat about to disturb
a seriously wounded soldier, the Red Cross nurse in
charge interposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Excuse me, madam,” she said, “but——”</p>

<p>She was rudely interrupted by Lady Snobleigh,
who cried:</p>

<p>“Woman, you forget yourself. I’m very particular
to whom I speak.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” quietly answered the nurse, “that is where
we differ. I’m not!”</p>


<h2>BLASTED HOPES</h2>

<p>“Where is the new recruit?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, since he went, an hour or two ago, to
sew on a button with guncotton, no one seems to
have seen anything of him.”</p>


<h2>PROFITABLE AUTHORSHIP</h2>

<p>The Girl—“And can you manage on your army
pay, Phil?”</p>

<p>The “Sub”—“Hardly; but I do a bit of writing
besides.”</p>

<p>The Girl—“What kind of writing?”</p>

<p>The “Sub”—“Oh, letters to the guv’nor!”</p>


<h2>THE “LONG, LONG TRAIL” OVER THERE</h2>

<p>Paris, Nov., 1918.—In the logging camps and sawmills,
in barracks and on the drill grounds, in camps
and on the march, in “Y” and Red Cross huts, at all
hours of the day and night, wherever in France the
Yank crusaders were at work, I have heard these lines
sung, hummed, and whistled:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There’s a long, long trail a-winding</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Into the land of my dreams,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the nightingales are singing</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a white moon beams.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There’s a long, long night of waiting</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Until my dreams all come true,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till the day when I’ll be going down</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That long, long trail with you.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Wherever a piano found its way into the American
lines someone was sure to be playing this chorus;
and, dodging in and out of a convoy along the rutted
and winding hillside roads in the zone of operations,
in drizzle and mud and low flung clouds, one was certain
to hear some camion load of lusty doughboys
going to the “Long Trail.”</p>

<p>But it remained for H. A. Rodeheaver, Billy Sunday’s
trombone expert, to put a new touch to it. He
put the “longing” into the long trail with a dash of
Sundayesqueness that smeared sawdust all over the
long trail.</p>

<p>“Rodey,” as the soldiers call him, has been singing
his way through the American camps in France and
emulating his picturesque master, when opportunity
afforded, by laying down a metaphorical “sawdust
trail” and inviting the boys to hit it again in their
hearts.</p>

<p>It was quite remarkable how many hands went up
in every camp and barracks and hut when he asked
them how many had attended a Sunday revival back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
home. Then he started singing the songs they heard
at these meetings, usually beginning with “Brighten
the Corner Where You Are.”</p>

<p>He has just the quality of voice that got down
deep over here, when the night was dark and damp
and the dim light but half illuminated the place, and
the boys naturally were letting their thoughts fly
back home. They warmed up to him, for he’s a good
scout, according to their way of thinking, and the
first thing they knew he was asking them to call for
any song they would like to hear. About the first
voice that responded called for the “Long, Long
Trail.”</p>

<p>“All right, men,” he said, with a sincere smile, and
his magnetic face, beneath the wavy black hair,
seemed to exude a hypnotic fascination. He nodded
to his pianist and they started. The barracks, or
hut, or camp resounded with the “Long Trail.”</p>

<p>“Fine, fine,” beamed Rodey from the rough board
platform. “You know, men, that’s a mighty fine
piece of music. Let’s sing it again; now, all
together,” and the sound swells a little higher this
time.</p>

<p>“Once more,” and Rodey waved his arm in lieu of
a baton.</p>

<p>The sea of faces brightened perceptibly, even
under the dim lights.</p>

<p>“Now, men,” said Rodey, “just sing that chorus
over again and I’ll try the trombone.”</p>

<p>That trombone did the business. Rodey gets a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sort of combination alto and tenor harmony out of
that old trombone that brings the home folks right
into the meeting.</p>

<p>“Now, men, once more, very softly,” and he played
the harmony plaintively and fetchingly.</p>

<p>He’s got ’em, and the moment has arrived for
sprinkling the sawdust.</p>

<p>“Before we go on with our little program, men,”
he said, “let us just bow our heads for a minute in
prayer and ask God to help us make the good fight,
help us to do the work we came over here to do like
men.” The men bowed their heads and he added:</p>

<p>“Just before we ask God’s blessing on these brave
men, if there is a boy out there who feels that he has
not been living quite as he knows his mother would
like to have him live, if there is a boy out there who
feels in an especial way the need of God’s help at
this hour, will he please raise his hand.”</p>

<p>The place was very still. A hand went up way in
the back.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rodey said. “God bless you, boy.”</p>

<p>Then another and another, and soon scores of
hands were held up, while they had their heads bowed.</p>

<p>Then Rodey prayed one of those conversational
prayers, and he made it a personal appeal for each
one of the boys whose hands had gone up.</p>

<p>It was not Rodey’s plan to send the boys back to
their barracks with only seriousness and longing in
their heads. He’s one of the most adroit handlers of
an audience in Europe. He’d got the main idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
planted and now he broke into smiles and there was
an infectious laugh in his voice.</p>

<p>He was again talking to red-blooded men who
were going out to fight. So he told a few corking
stories, humorous but clean, and got down to them
instead of talking over them. He was one of ’em.
He wanted to send them away with a good taste in
their mouths.</p>

<p>Dunbar’s “When Melinda Sings” he does to perfection.
Once in awhile he pulls the “Hunk o’ Tin”
parody on the Kipling poem.</p>

<p>Then they sing some more, both democratic music
and old hymns, and finally they all stand up, after
he has launched a two-minute patriotic talk that
thrills, and sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</p>

<p>Rodey never has a set program. He sizes up each
new audience with a glance and in two minutes knows
about what line of entertainment he ought to give
them. If it’s a crowd that likes good stories, they
get it. If it is a meeting that likes a Bible talk, they
get that, and the great Sunday himself hasn’t much
on his pupil in that line. But he never lets a crowd
get away with a solemn face. He leads them up the
hill and down the hill, and finally sends them back
to the blankets feeling refreshed, inspirited, and
cheerful.</p>

<p>And when Rodey hit a camp of Negro troops—man,
O man! what he did to them!</p>

<p>He thinks the war has been a holy war, a war of
crusaders against the terrible Huns, and wants them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
beaten to a standstill. He insists on the knockout
punch, and believes the world will be a better world
for everybody after Fritz and his gang have been
completely chastized.—<span class="smcap">Charles N. Wheeler</span>, in
<i>The Chicago Tribune</i>.</p>


<h2>HIS OWN PERSONAL WAR</h2>

<p>General Leonard Wood tells the story of a captain
to whom was assigned a new orderly, a fresh recruit.
“Your work will be to clean my boots, buttons, belt,
and so forth, shave me, see to my horse, which you
must groom thoroughly, and clean the equipment.
After that you go to your hut, help to serve the
breakfast, and after breakfast lend a hand washing
up. At eight o’clock you go on parade and drill till
twelve o’clock——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” broke in the recruit, “is there
anyone else in the army besides me?”</p>


<h2>WHEN TOMMY LAUGHS</h2>

<p>There are many bright lines in the soldiers’ letters
home, as <i>Punch</i> and other papers note.</p>

<p>“A clergyman recently gave a lecture on ‘Fools’
at the ‘hut’ back of our station,” writes a boy from
the Somme. “The tickets of admission were inscribed,
‘Lecture on Fools. Admit one.’ There was
a large audience.”</p>

<p>And from Calais comes this:</p>

<p>“You will note with interest and tell the shirkers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
they’re missing something here. The ‘G’ came off the
big sign east of the station here and we now read:
‘The only English love makers in the city.’”</p>


<h2>ONE OF THOSE IRISH BULLS</h2>

<p>The recruit from Ireland spent his leave in England.
Asked on his return to the front what he
thought of the place, he said:</p>

<p>“Faith, London is a great city; but it’s no place
for a poor man unless he has plenty of money.”</p>


<h2>WHEN GERMANY SALUTED A PIG</h2>

<p>A Belgian farmer saved his bacon in an unusual
way. He heard that the Germans were coming, so
he killed and dressed his one pig, cleaned it, put it
into his bed with only a part of the underface exposed,
and put a lighted candle at each side of the
bed. When the Germans arrived an officer entered
the house, went into the room, saw what he believed
to be a member of the family laid out for burial,
saluted and went out!</p>


<h2>AND SO IT PROVED</h2>

<p>Arthur Train, the novelist, put down a German
newspaper at the Century Club, in New York, with
an impatient grunt.</p>

<p>“It says here,” he explained, “that it is Germany
who will speak the last word in this war.”</p>

<p>Then the novelist laughed angrily and added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Germany will speak the last word in the
war, and that last word will be ‘Kamerad!’”</p>


<h2>WASHINGTON GETS THESE, TOO</h2>

<p>They have some exceptional letters in the London
“Family Separation” office, which looks after the
families of soldiers at the front. These are all actual
letters received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Sir—You have changed my little boy into
a little girl. Will it make any difference?</p>

<div class='sig'>
“Respectfully yours,<br />
”—— ——.“<br />
</div>

<p>“My Bill has been put in charge of a spittoon.
Will I get more pay?” [“Platoon” was meant.]</p>

<p>“I am glad to tell you that my husband has been
reported dead.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t get my husband’s money soon I shall
be compelled to go on the streets and lead an Imortal
life.”</p>

<p>“Dear Sir—In accordance with instructions on
paper, I have given birth to a daughter last week.</p>

<div class='sig'>
“Truly yours,<br />
”—— ——.“<br />
</div></div>


<h2>BLACK MAGIC</h2>

<p>“Yes, sah,” said one negro, “a friend of mine who
knows all about it says dis heah man Edison has done
gone and invented a magnetized bullet dat can’t miss
a German, kase ef dere’s one in a hundred yards de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bullet is drawn right smack against his steel helmet.
Yes, sah, an’ he’s done invented another one with a
return attachment. Whenever dat bullet don’t hit
nothin’ it comes right straight back to de American
lines.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I call inventin’,” exclaimed his colored
listener. “But how about dem comin’-back bullets?
What do dey do to keep ’em from hittin’ ouah men
when dey come back?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Edison made ’em so he’s got ’em
trained. You don’t s’pose he’d let ’em kill any Americans,
do you? No, sah. He’s got ’em fixet so’s dey
jes’ ease back down aroun’ de gunner’s feet an’ sort
o’ say: ‘Dey’s all dead in dat trench, boss. Send me
to a live place where I’se got a chancet to do somethin’.’”</p>


<h2>SUCH EXCUSES AS THEY MAKE</h2>

<p>A soldier was brought up for stealing his trench
bunkie’s liquor.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sor,” he said. “But I put the liquor
for the two of us in the same bottle. Mine was at the
bottom, an’ I was obliged to drink his to get mine.”</p>


<h2>HE HAD TROUBLES, TOO</h2>

<p>At a church adjacent to a big military camp a
service was recently held for soldiers only.</p>

<p>“Let all you brave fellows who have troubles stand
up,” shouted the preacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly every man rose except one.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the preacher, peering at this lone
individual. “You are one in a thousand.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t that,” piped back the only man who had
remained seated, as the rest of his comrades gazed
suspiciously at him. “Somebody’s put some cobbler’s
wax on the seat, and I’m stuck.”</p>


<h2>WHAT COULD HE MEAN?</h2>

<p>An army chaplain was trudging along a hot, dusty
road with a company of soldiers. As they stopped to
rest and to get a drink of water at a farm house the
farmer’s wife said to the chaplain:</p>

<p>“You go everywhere the soldiers go, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” answered the preacher, “not everywhere;
only in this world.”</p>


<h2>NEVER MIND THE TARGET</h2>

<p>The subject of rifle shooting often crops up at
one of the training camps.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet anyone here a box of cigars,” said Lieut.
A., “that I can fire twenty-one shots at 200 yards and
tell without waiting for the marker the result of each
one correctly.”</p>

<p>“Done!” cried Maj. B. And the whole mess turned
out early the next morning to witness the experiment.</p>

<p>The lieutenant fired.</p>

<p>“Miss!” he announced calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Another shot.</p>

<p>“Miss!” he repeated.</p>

<p>A third shot.</p>

<p>“Miss!”</p>

<p>“Here, hold on!” put in Maj. B. “What are you
trying to do? You’re not firing for the target!”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” was the cool response. “I’m firing
for those cigars!”</p>


<h2>A LADY FROM HELL</h2>

<p>Two “kilties” from the same town met in a rest
camp “somewhere in France” and started exchanging
confidences.</p>

<p>“Whit like a sendoff did yer wuman gie ye, Sandy,
when ye left for France?” asked Jock presently.</p>

<p>Sandy lit a fresh cigaret before he replied frankly:</p>

<p>“Says she, ‘Noo, there’s yer train, Sandy; in ye
get, an’ see an’ do yer duty. By jingo, ma mannie,
if I thocht ye wed shirk it oot yonder I wud see ye
was wounded afore ye gang off.’ That’s the sendoff
she gaed me, Jock.”</p>


<h2>THEORY VS. FACT</h2>

<p>United States Senator Howard Sutherland, of
West Virginia, tells a story about a mountain youth
who visited a recruiting office in the Senator’s State
for the purpose of enlisting in the regular army.
The examining physician found the young man as
sound as a dollar, but that he had flat feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said the physician, “but I’ll have to
turn you down. You’ve got flat feet.”</p>

<p>The mountaineer looked sorrowful. “No way for
me to git in it, then?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I guess not. With those flat feet of yours you
wouldn’t be able to march even five miles.”</p>

<p>The youth from the mountains studied a moment.
Finally he said: “I’ll tell you why I hate this so
darned bad. You see, I walked nigh on to one hundred
and fifty miles over the mountains to git here,
and gosh, how I hate to walk back!”</p>


<h2>ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIER!</h2>

<p>Two men went to the Y. M. C. A. director in one
of the camps and said that they were in the habit of
kneeling down and saying their prayers at home.
What ought they to do here?</p>

<p>“Try it out,” was the advice.</p>

<p>They did; the second night two others in the barracks
joined them; the third night a few more; gradually
the number increased until considerably more
than half the men resumed the habit of childhood
and knelt by their cots in prayer before turning in.</p>

<p>A company captain in one of the cantonments the
first evening his men stood at attention for retreat
said: “Men, this is a serious business we are engaged
in; it is fitting that we should pray about it.” There
and then this Plattsburg Reserve officer made a simple
and earnest prayer for the divine blessing upon
their lives and their work. The impression upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
men was described as tremendous. Such incidents
indicate the general spirit of the new armies.</p>


<h2>WHO WAS THE JOKE ON?</h2>

<p>They are telling the story in London taprooms of
a German soldier who laughed uproariously all the
time he was being flogged. When the officer, at the
end, inquired the cause of the private’s mirth, the
latter broke into a fresh fit of laughter and cried:</p>

<p>“Why, I’m the wrong man!”</p>


<h2>REAL YANKEE LANGUAGE</h2>

<p>A French soldier who came proudly up to an
American in a certain headquarters town the other
day asked:</p>

<p>“You spik French?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” answered the American, “not yet.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman smiled complacently.</p>

<p>“Aye spik Eengleesh,” he said. The American
grinned and the Frenchman looked about for some
means to show his prowess in the foreign tongue. At
that moment a French girl, very neat and trim in
her peaked hat, long coat, and high laced boots, came
along. The Frenchman jerked his head toward her,
looked knowingly at the American, and said triumphantly:
“Chicken.”</p>

<p>The American roared.</p>

<p>“Shake,” he said, extending his hand. “You don’t
speak English; you speak American.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h2>DAMN THE KAISER</h2>

<p>The grit of the British Tommy is amazing, as told
by a Swiss correspondent who found himself with
fourteen soldiers in a barn. A huge German shell
suddenly “found” the barn in the very center and
wrecked it. It was pitch dark; the Swiss was seriously
wounded and decided to lay still until help should
come. Suddenly a voice spoke out of the dark:</p>

<p>“Anyone left here?”</p>

<p>“Right here, old chap,” came an answer.</p>

<p>“Ah.” Then silence, and in a few moments came:
“Say, old man, think you could give me a bit of a
lift. Seems both of my pins are gone.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, old chap,” came the answer. “Wish I
could, but they found both of my hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” came the answer. Then, after a pause:
“That’s a bit inconvenient, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” was the reply.</p>

<p>After a few moments:</p>

<p>“Hell of a rumpus, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite.”</p>

<p>“Well,” came the final word, “someone will come
along and find us.”</p>

<p>And “someone” did.</p>


<h2>FUN FOR THE MISSUS</h2>

<p>A padre passing up and down among the wounded
at a field hospital asked a wounded Jock whether he
would like to dictate a letter home. The Jock assented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Thereupon the minister prepared to take
down the letter, but found Jock tongue-tied and
unable to begin.</p>

<p>“Come along, now!” said the padre kindly. “We
must make a start. What shall I say?”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“Shall I begin ‘My Dear Wife?’”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Jock, “pit that doon. That’ll amuse
her!”</p>


<h2>GERMAN RESTITUTION</h2>

<p>“Any restitution Germany offers to the Allies will
be offered, you may be sure, in the spirit of Griggs.”</p>

<p>The speaker was Edward Hungerford, the advertising
expert.</p>

<p>“Griggs and Miggs,” he went on, “were kidnapped
by bandits and shut up in a cave.</p>

<p>“‘They’ll take every cent we’ve got on us,’ moaned
Miggs. ‘Every blessed cent.’</p>

<p>“‘They will, eh?’ said Griggs, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“‘They sure will.’</p>

<p>“Griggs peeled a ten-spot from his roll.</p>

<p>“‘Here, Miggs,’ he said, ‘here is that ten dollars
I’ve been owin’ you for so long.’”</p>


<h2>BUT DID CHARLEY TELL IT?</h2>

<p>“Charley, dear,” said young Mrs. Torkins, “I have
thought up a witticism for you to tell at the club.”</p>

<p>“Do I have to tell it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course not. But you’ll miss a great chance
if you don’t. It’s this: Baseball players ought to
be put into the navy instead of the army. Go on;
ask me ‘Why?’”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“So that they can steal submarine bases.”</p>


<h2>LONG-DISTANCE FAREWELL</h2>

<p>The word came that a company of soldiers in an
Eastern camp would leave the next morning on a
transport for France. One soldier came from Portland,
Ore. Quickly he went to the public telephone
pay station and put in a call for his mother. For an
hour he paced back and forth before that booth, and
then came the word “Portland is on the wire.” Slowly
but impressively this boy in khaki dropped one hundred
25-cent pieces in the slot, and for a precious five
minutes that boy heard his mother’s voice and she
heard the good-by of her boy. Then, dripping wet
from the nervous strain, he ran for his barracks to
get ready for France and the trenches.</p>


<h2>NINE GIRLS TOO MANY</h2>

<p>He was a strikingly handsome figure in his uniform
as he started out upon his round of farewell
calls.</p>

<p>“And you’ll think of me every single minute when
you’re in those stupid old trenches?” questioned the
sweet young thing upon whom he first called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded emphatically. “Every minute.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll kiss my picture every night?”</p>

<p>“Twice a night,” he vowed rashly, patting the
pretty head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“And write me long, long letters?” she insisted.</p>

<p>“Every spare minute I have,” he reassured her,
and hurried away to the next name on his list.</p>

<p>There were ten in all who received his promises.</p>

<p>When it was over he sighed. “I hope,” he murmured
wearily, “there won’t be much fighting to do
‘over there.’ I’m going to be so tremendously busy.”</p>


<h2>WHY NOT BOTH?</h2>

<p>The adjutant was lecturing to the subalterns of
the battalion.</p>

<p>“In the field,” he said, “it is now incumbent upon
an officer to make himself look as much like a man as
possible.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“That is, I mean,” he explained, “as much like a
soldier as possible.”</p>


<h2>ONLY GOOD GERMANS WERE LEFT</h2>

<p>One of the brightest young business men of Pittsburgh
enrolled as a volunteer and by his quick intelligence
soon won an officer’s commission. He led his
troops in the attack on Bouresches, and so hot was the
fight that a major was sent from headquarters to
learn the worst. He met the young officer coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
out of the town with part of his company. The
major happened to be a pompous gentleman, well
known for his egotism. Having no faith in anyone to
“finish a job,” he asked the young officer:</p>

<p>“What’s the condition of Bouresches?”</p>

<p>“In our hands, sir. I left a detachment to guard
the town,” replied the young officer.</p>

<p>“Any boches left?” was the next question.</p>

<p>The young officer hesitated and then said:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>A lurid interlude followed. “Did not your orders
from me say that no Germans were to be left there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the young officer.</p>

<p>“Then why in hell have you disobeyed my orders,
hey?” asked the irate major.</p>

<p>The young Pittsburgher looked the major in the
eye and replied: “The burying patrol has not arrived
yet, sir.”</p>


<h2>A BREEZY RETORT</h2>

<p>The recruiting had been good and the orator of
the occasion felt well satisfied with himself. It would
be graceful, he thought, to speak a few concluding
words to the crowd of men who had dedicated themselves
to “king and country.”</p>

<p>“And what will you think when you see the flag
of the empire standing out from its staff above the
field of battle?” the speaker demanded, his face alight
with patriotic fervor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Standin’ straight out, guv’nor?” a stolid recruit
questioned earnestly.</p>

<p>“Why—er—yes!” the orator responded, in some
confusion.</p>

<p>“I should think, then,” the future Tommy announced
gravely, “that the wind was blowin’ ’ard.”</p>


<h2>PATTING MISSOURI ON THE BACK</h2>

<p>We’re glad to see that General Foch is studying
this column for ideas to help speed up the winning of
the war. A month or so ago we quoted a paragraph
of Jack Blanton’s, advising General Foch that, while
defensive fighting was all right for awhile, all the
great battles of the world had been won by the
armies which took the offensive. Yesterday’s papers
quoted General Foch to the same effect. We’ve suspected
all along that the unofficial boards of strategy
in Paris, Mo., and other country towns knew lots
more about the war-problems than anybody in Paris,
France, and this proves it.—<i>Kansas City Times.</i></p>


<h2>YOU CAN’T BEAT SUCH BOYS</h2>

<p>When the lad came to in the shell hole he thought
at first somebody had emptied a bucket of warm
water on his face and breast. But it happened to be
blood from a nasty wound running down his cheek
and along his chin. He’d not known, naturally,
when it had happened. A little wabbly, he was reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for his rifle when a field surgeon slid down the
bank and confronted him.</p>

<p>“Can you walk?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure, why not?” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Why, man, you’re wounded!” the surgeon exclaimed.</p>

<p>The kid’s eyes flashed. “No, sir,” he said with a
gory grin; “I was leaning against the German barrage
when the Huns lifted it and I fell and cut my
chin. That’s all. Please let me stay.”</p>


<h2>HOW TO BE FUNNY IN WARTIME</h2>

<p>This subject is discussed by W. H. Berry, an
actor whose “High Jinks” has been going strong
with London theater-goers.</p>

<p>“It is far more necessary for a comedian to get the
laughs in time of war,” says Berry, “and I know that
many of our comedians have worked their hardest on
the nights when there was bad news in the papers.</p>

<p>“There are only a few subjects taboo, but they
should be shunned absolutely. I object, for example,
to a joke I heard not long ago about wounded soldiers
who had to wear glass eyes. I consider such jokes
offensive in the highest degree. As a wag of my
acquaintance remarked the other day, ‘Some of these
war jokes are too warful for words.’</p>

<p>“There are, however, certain subjects allied to the
war on which I consider it perfectly legitimate to jest.
There is the censorship. There are our pitchy streets
at night time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“For instance, I myself have perpetrated wheezelets’
on these topics in ‘High Jinks,’ of which the
following are fair samples:</p>

<p>“‘Would you believe it, it’s so dark now in London
that when I dined at the Carlton the other night
I had to put luminous paint on my potatoes to stop
myself putting them in the mouth of the gentleman
next to me.</p>

<p>“‘It’s so dark that when I go to the opera I take a
trained glow worm with me.</p>

<p>“‘He’s a wealthy man, indeed—he’s got a whole
box of matches in his pocket.’”</p>


<h2>NOW ON A WAR-BASIS</h2>

<p>His Honor—“Rufus, didn’t you hear that you
had to work or fight?”</p>

<p>Rufus—“Yaas, boss, I sho’ dun hyer dat. So I
goes an’ gits married right away.”</p>


<h2>HUMANITY IN WAR</h2>

<p>During a fierce engagement on the Somme battlefield
a British officer saw a German officer impaled on
the barbed wire between the lines, writhing in anguish.
The fire was heavy, but still the wounded man hung
there. At last the Englishman could stand it no
longer. He said quietly: “I can’t bear to look at
that poor chap.” He went out under the storm of
shell fire, released the sufferer, took him on his
shoulders and carried him to the German trench. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
firing ceased. Both sides watched the act with
wonder. Then the commander in the German trench
came forward, took from his own bosom the Iron
Cross, and pinned it on the breast of the British
officer.</p>


<h2>FLATLY IMPOSSIBLE</h2>

<p>“Yes,” said Simpkins, “I want to do my bit, of
course, so I thought I’d raise some potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I would do that,” said Smith,
“but when I looked up the way to do it I found that
potatoes have to be planted in hills, and our yard is
perfectly flat.”</p>


<h2>THE FRATERNAL SIDE OF WAR</h2>

<p>Jean is a typical French soldier: alert, daring; a
keen, educated youth. He is equally at home with
the German and the French languages, which accounts
for what follows:</p>

<p>One dark night, shortly after midnight, Jean—on
a solitary patrol—was lying just outside the wire,
about ten meters from the German trench, listening
to locate the sentries. There was a faint starlight.
Suddenly a whisper came from beyond the wire, a low
voice speaking in broken French:</p>

<p>“Why do you lie so quiet, my friend? I saw you
crawl up and have watched you ever since. I don’t
want to shoot you. I am a Bavarian.”</p>

<p>“Good evening, then,” Jean whispered back in his
perfect German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“So,” said the sentry, “you speak our language.
Wait a moment, till I warn the rest of my squad, and
I will show you the way through the wire; there are
no officers about at this hour.”</p>

<p>Probably not one man in a thousand would have
taken such a chance, but Jean did, and ten minutes
later was standing in the trench in a German cloak
and fatigue cap (in case of passing officers), chatting
amiably with a much interested group of Bavarian
soldiers. They gave him beer, showed him their dugouts,
and arranged a whistle signal for future visits,
before bidding him a regretful good night. “We
are Bavarians,” they said; “we like and admire the
French, and fight only because we must.”</p>


<h2>NO TIME TO WASTE</h2>

<p>Two soldiers caused some amusement at a golf
course the other way. The first man teed up and
made a mighty swipe, but failed to shift the ball. The
miss was repeated no fewer than three times.</p>

<p>His pal was unable to stand it any longer.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Bill,” he broke out, “hit the
bloomin’ thing. You know we have only four days’
leave.”</p>


<h2>HER GENTLE COME-BACK</h2>

<p>She was a sweet young thing, and having come
down to see her soldier brother, who was on duty at
that time, she was being taken round by his chum.
She was, of course, full of questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is that person?” she asked, pointing to a
color sergeant.</p>

<p>“Oh! he shook hands with the king; that is why he
is wearing a crown on his arm, you see!” replied the
truthful man.</p>

<p>“And who is that?” she asked, seeing a gymnastic
instructor with a badge of crossed Indian clubs.</p>

<p>“That is the barber; do you not see the scissors on
his arm?”</p>

<p>Seeing yet another man with cuffs decorated with
stars, she asked, “And that one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is the battalion astronomer; he guides
us on night maneuvers!”</p>

<p>“How interesting!” replied the maiden, when seeing
her companion’s badge, that of an ancient
stringed instrument, she asked, “And does that thing
mean you are the regimental liar?”</p>


<h2>HIS MIND WAS WANDERING</h2>

<p>“Anything I can do for you?” asked a surgeon as
he passed the bed of a smiling but badly wounded
soldier.</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor; perhaps you can tell me something
I’d very much like to know,” answered “Sammie.”</p>

<p>“Fire ahead,” replied the doctor. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, doctor, when one doctor doctors another
doctor, does the doctor doing the doctoring doctor
the other doctor like the doctor wants to be doctored,
or does the doctor doing the doctoring doctor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
other doctor like the doctor doing the doctoring
wants to doctor him?”</p>


<h2>THE SEX OF THE KILTIES</h2>

<p>While some Scottish regiments were disembarking
in France, several French officers were watching
them. One observed: “They can’t be women, for
they have mustaches; but they can’t be men, for they
wear skirts.”</p>

<p>“I have it,” said another. “They’re that famous
Middlesex regiment from London.”</p>

<h2>HE’D BEEN THERE HIMSELF</h2>

<p>Two colored troopers in France called upon the
Chaplain.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Chaplain, we wants you for to
settle an argument,” said one of them. “Dis here
man says lots of saints were colored folks. Would
you please tell me how many of dem ’postles were
niggers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“None of them was a darky,” said the Chaplain.</p>

<p>“Well, Sir, that settles it. Dis man wanted me
to believe that St. Peter was a nigger, and I just
told him: ‘No, Sah, St. Peter was no nigger, ’cause
I heard you say about St. Peter and dat rooster
crowin’ twice. If St. Peter was a nigger I jest know
dat rooster would never have a chance to crow a
second time; no, Sah.’”</p>


<h2>EIGHTEEN YEARS OF HOPE</h2>

<p>A wife whose husband is on active service recently
presented him with a bouncing baby boy. She wrote
to ask him when he should get leave, and also when
the war would be over. His reply was as follows:</p>

<p>“Dear Lucy:—I don’t know when I shall get leave
or when the war will be over, but if the baby should
be called up before I get leave, give him a parcel
to bring out to me. Your loving husband, Bill.”</p>


<h2>A NICKNAME THAT STUCK</h2>

<p>The Post School for Soldiers gathered for the
afternoon session. The teacher was the Chaplain.
The lesson, he said, was about the adverb. “What
is an adverb?” There was an eloquent silence. At
last a weary voice ventured: “That’s a word that
ends in ly. I learned that back in Missouri.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me a definition?” said the Chaplain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Sir.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me an example of an adverb?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir,” came the response; “Kelly.”</p>

<p>Some months afterward, while in camp overseas,
the Chaplain addressed a sentry and inquired who
was Corporal of the guard. And the answer came:
“Kelly, the adverb, Sir.”</p>


<h2>PAT WAS SMOKING</h2>

<p>Scene: A smoking compartment in a British railway
carriage.</p>

<p>Old Gent (to Pat going home to Monaghan on furlough)—“Young
man, allow me to inform you that
out of every ten cases of men suffering from paralysis
of the tongue, nine are due to smoking.”</p>

<p>Pat—“Allow me to inform you, sir, that out of
every ten men suffering from broken noses, nine are
due to the habit of not minding their own business.”</p>


<h2>FORGOT HIS LINES</h2>

<p>The Canadians are credited with the story of the
stupid Yorkshire sentry:</p>

<p>The first night he stood guard he hailed an approaching
officer in proper form:</p>

<p>“’Oo goes there?”</p>

<p>“Canadian rifles.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Then the Yorkshireman
repeated:</p>

<p>“’Oo goes there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Canadian Rifles,” was the impatient answer.
More silence. Then the Yorkshireman again challenged:</p>

<p>“’Oo goes there?”</p>

<p>“The Canadian rifles, you qualified blighter,”
shouted the enraged officer.</p>

<p>There was a long period of quiet while the Canadian
watched the Yorkshireman’s obviously ready
rifle. Then there was a moan from the sentry:</p>

<p>“Blowed if I hain’t forgot what to say next!”</p>


<h2>SO THERE’S PLENTY OF IT</h2>

<p>William Thaw, the young Pittsburgh millionaire
who has done such wonderful flying in France, was
being praised at a luncheon party.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thaw,” said a pretty girl, “is as brave as
he is witty. I saw him make a splendid flight one
day, and on his descent I said to him:</p>

<p>“‘Flying requires some special application,
doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no,’ said he. ‘Any old kind of horse liniment
will do.’”</p>


<h2>LIVELY ENEMY</h2>

<p>A company of very new soldiers were out on a
wide heath, practicing the art of taking cover. The
officer in charge of them turned to one of the rawest
of his men.</p>

<p>“Get down behind that hillock there,” he ordered,
sternly, “and, mind, not a move or a sound!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later he looked around to see if
they were all concealed, and, to his despair, observed
something wriggling behind the small mound. Even
as he watched the movements became more frantic.</p>

<p>“I say, you there,” he shouted, angrily, “do you
know you are giving our position away to the enemy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the recruit, in a voice of cool desperation,
“and do you know that this is an anthill?”</p>


<h2>NO REGRETS</h2>

<p>A certain drill sergeant, whose severity had made
him unpopular with his troops, was putting a party
of recruits through the funeral service. Opening
the ranks so as to admit the passage of the supposed
cortege between them, the instructor, by way of explanation,
walked slowly down the lane formed by
the two ranks, saying, as he did so:</p>

<p>“Now, I’m the corpse. Pay attention.”</p>

<p>Having reached the end of the path, he turned
round, regarding them steadily with a scrutinizing
eye for a moment or two, then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Your ’ands is right, and your ’eads is right, but
you haven’t got that look of regret you ought to
’ave.”</p>


<h2>TOO MUCH WASTED EFFORT</h2>

<p>A squad of rookies, composed of various nationalities,
mostly Italian, on being given the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
“mark time!” all executed the command with the exception
of one small dark-skinned son of Naples.</p>

<p>The sergeant asked him why he did not execute
the movement and he replied:</p>

<p>“Donna wan to.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” sharply demanded the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Cause-a we walk-a like deuce and don’t-a get-a
no place!”</p>


<h2>MAD ENOUGH TO LICK ANYONE</h2>

<p>Before entering the Army this rookie was a peaceful
lad, but rising at 5:15 in the morning went
against his principles. On this particular morning,
as he fell in line by the light of the moon, his bunkie
heard him mutter:</p>

<p>“It’s clear to me now. Why didn’t I think of that
long ago?”</p>

<p>Bunkie (puzzled)—“What’s clear to you now?”</p>

<p>Rookie—“The reason why all great battles begin
at daybreak.”</p>

<p>Bunkie—“Why?”</p>

<p>Rookie—“Because, when men have to get up that
time, they feel so much like fighting.”</p>


<h2>WORKING THE WAR</h2>

<p>Bess: “That’s Mrs. Grabbit—she’s a great war-worker.”</p>

<p>Bob: “Indeed!”</p>

<p>Bess: “Yes; she’s married four of her daughters
to soldiers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h2>SANDY WAS SCOTCH</h2>

<p>Sandy M’Tavish was a highly-skilled workman in
a new aeroplane factory. It happened one day that
he was asked if he would care to accompany the works
aviator on one of his trial flights in a machine.
Sandy, after some hesitation, agreed to do so.</p>

<p>During the flight the aviator asked how he was enjoying
the trip.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth,” answered the Scot, “I wad
rather be on the groun’.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” replied the flying man. “I’m just
thinking of looping the loop.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake don’t dae that!” yelled the
now very serious M’Tavish. “I’ve some siller in
my vest pocket, an’ I micht lose it.”</p>


<h2>BROWN WASN’T GREEN</h2>

<p>Brown was transferred to another unit his
adjutant wrote to the adjutant of the new regiment
saying: “We are sending you Brown. He is a nice
boy, but he has a shocking bad habit of betting
on every conceivable subject. Try and choke him
off.”</p>

<p>Brown arrived. At mess on the first night he sat
next the colonel and, turning the conversation on
India, made the astounding assertion that every white
man who went there developed a curious green patch
between the shoulder-blades. This rubbish annoyed
the colonel. He said that he certainly had no green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
patch on his back. Brown, with all deference, offered
to bet him ten pounds that he had! The bet
was accepted by the indignant officer, and in the ante-room
afterwards he pulled off his shirt. There was
no patch. Brown apologized and paid up. Next
day the adjutant wrote to Brown’s former regiment:
“Brown turned up. * * * I think we have
choked him off. Last night he bet the colonel, etc.
* * * and lost.”</p>

<p>The reply came: “Thanks for yours. Before
Brown left here he bet us ten pounds apiece all round
the mess that he would make the colonel take off his
shirt in the ante-room on the first night he arrived.”</p>


<h2>ANYTHING TO GET AWAY</h2>

<p>A soldier was pleading with his O. C.</p>

<p>“You are always on leave,” exclaimed the officer.
“What on earth do you want special leave for now?”</p>

<p>“My sister’s baby going to be vaccinated, sir.”</p>

<p>“And what has that got to do with you?”</p>

<p>“She’s my sister, sir,” explained Tommy, with a
hurt look.</p>

<p>“What, the baby?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, the baby’s sister’s my brother—I mean
I’m the mother’s baby—er—the father’s my sister.
No, I mean—”</p>

<p>“You mean,” broke in the O. C., angrily. “What
do they want you for? That is the point.”</p>

<p>“For a godmother, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h2>NATURALLY WISHED TO SEE HER</h2>

<p>Private McGuire, lying in hospital, was very fractious.
He pointedly refused to take a second dose
of medicine, which was inordinately nasty. Several
smiling nurses bent over him and urged him to be
good.</p>

<p>“Come,” pleaded one, “drink this and you’ll get
well.”</p>

<p>“And rosy, too!” chimed in a second.</p>

<p>M’Guire visibly brightened, and actually sat up
in bed.</p>

<p>After surveying the pretty group, he inquired,
eagerly, “What wan o’ yez is Rosy?”</p>


<h2>ZEPPELINITIS</h2>

<p>Mr. Meek was not very well, and the doctor had
advised him to take a glass of beer occasionally “for
his stomach’s sake.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be done, doctor; it can’t be done,” said
Mr. Meek. “Although there is a barrel of beer in
the cellar, my wife insists on my being teetotal for
the duration of the war.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said the doctor, as he took his leave;
“you must invent a way to overcome your wife’s
scruples; an easy matter enough, surely?”</p>

<p>A few days later the medical man received a visit
from Mrs. Meek, who was greatly concerned as to the
state of her husband’s health. “I am afraid, doctor,”
she said, “that the poor man has had a nervous breakdown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
He’s continually fancying that he can hear
Zeppelins, and goes to hide in the cellar; besides
which he often appears to be somewhat strange and
aggressive in his manner.”</p>


<h2>PALESTINE VS. PURGATORY</h2>

<p>In a small village in Ireland the mother of a soldier
met the village priest, who asked her if she
had had bad news.</p>

<p>“Shure, I have,” she said. “Pat has been killed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am very sorry,” said the priest. “Did
you receive word from the War Office?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I received word from himself.”</p>

<p>The priest looked perplexed, and said, “But how
is that?”</p>

<p>“Shure,” she said, “here is the letter, read it for
yourself.”</p>

<p>The letter said: “Dear Mother—I am now in the
Holy Land.”</p>


<h2>DON’T ALL SPEAK AT ONCE</h2>

<p>The American Red Cross has inaugurated so many
different kinds of bureaus since its arrival in France,
that it is difficult to enumerate them or to know
what their duties consist of, but its newest bureau,
according to the last issue of the Bulletin, appears
to be dabbling in matrimonial matters. The following
paragraph is taken from the Red Cross Bulletin,
showing that anything might be called for at the
headquarters:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wanted—An American husband.”</p>

<p>“No kidding. It’s a fact. If you are an eligible
young man of American nationality who wants a
wife but cannot find anybody that wants to marry
you, apply to the office of the Secretary General.</p>

<p>“The office of the Secretary General has not become
a matrimonial agency, but received a letter
from a French woman in which the writer extolled
her excellent qualities and asked that she be found
an American husband.”</p>


<h2>WELL SEASONED</h2>

<p>A soldier in hospital, on recovering consciousness,
said:</p>

<p>“Nurse, what is this on my head?”</p>

<p>“Vinegar cloths,” she replied. “You have had
fever.” After a pause.</p>

<p>“And what is this on my chest?”</p>

<p>“A mustard-plaster. You have had pneumonia.”</p>

<p>“And what is this at my feet?”</p>

<p>“Salt-bags; you have had frost-bite.”</p>

<p>A soldier from the next bed looked up and said:</p>

<p>“Hang the pepper-box to his nose, nurse, then he
will be a cruet.”</p>


<h2>NOT TO BE DONE</h2>

<p>A certain soldier always looked on the dark side
of things. One day a friend tried to cheer him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do as the song says, ‘Pack all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
your troubles in your old kitbag, and smile, smile,
smile’?”</p>

<p>“I tried that once,” he said, sadly, “but the Quartermaster
didn’t have enough kitbags.”</p>


<h2>UNCERTAIN TRAIN SCHEDULE</h2>

<p>A soldier was waiting for the Muddleton train, the
only one of the day. After he had waited for an unreasonable
time the porter hove in sight.</p>

<p>“How long will I have to wait,” the soldier asked,
“for that bally train?”</p>

<p>“How long have you got?” asked the porter, with
apparent irrelevance.</p>

<p>“Fourteen days.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the porter, “you’d better walk.”</p>


<h2>REAL STRATEGY</h2>

<p>A young but distinguished major on furlough
was visiting a house where the family consisted of
several eligible daughters. The good lady of the
house was quick to notice that one of her daughters
seemed to be making a favorable impression on her
visitor. So before he took his departure the artful
mother whispered to him: “There’s a story going
the rounds, major, that you are going to marry my
daughter Hilda. What shall I say?”</p>

<p>“Just say, my dear madam, that your charming
and beautiful daughter refused me,” was the tactful
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h2>HE KNEW THE BREED</h2>

<p>A young British private was on night guard at a
lonely outpost in France, when suddenly he heard
the tramp of an advancing regiment. “Halt!” he
called. “Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“Irish Fusiliers.”</p>

<p>“Pass, Irish Fusiliers, all’s well.”</p>

<p>Silence reigned for some minutes and then he
heard another regiment advancing. “Halt! Who
goes there?”</p>

<p>“London Scottish.”</p>

<p>“Pass, London Scottish, all’s well.”</p>

<p>For some time there was silence, and then another
regiment was heard. “Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“None of your d—— business!”</p>

<p>“Pass, Canadians, all’s well.”</p>


<h2>DESERVED PROMOTION</h2>

<p>“Don’t keep calling me ‘general.’ I’m only a colonel.”</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, boss. I ain’t disputin’ yo’ word,
but any military gent’man dat gives dis old waiter
a dollar tip is jes natcherly a ‘gen’ral.’”</p>


<h2>MIXED HER DATES</h2>

<p>The Khaki Gentleman: “Do you love me, darling?”</p>

<p>She: “Yes, Jack, dear.”</p>

<p>The Khaki Gentleman: “Jack! My name’s Harold!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>She (who has numerous admirers—one for each
day of the week): “Oh, yes, of course! I keep thinking
this is Saturday!”</p>


<h2>HOOVER, GOD AND THREE OTHERS</h2>

<p>A boy who had a habit of leaving food on his
plate was told by his nurse that Mr. Hoover would
get after him.</p>

<p>“Well, that makes five,” despondently said the boy.</p>

<p>“Five?” asked the nurse. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” was the answer, “I’ve always had to mind
daddy and mother and Aunt Mary and God, and now
here comes along Mr. Hoover.”</p>


<h2>IT TAKES FIFTEEN YEARS, SON</h2>

<p>A young recruit, fresh from a New Hampshire
farm, sat watching a group of men in camp, engaged
in the usual pastime—“the great American game.”
After watching the game silently for a time he inquired:
“Is that poker you fellows are playing?”
On being informed that it was, he volunteered:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be darned! I’ve been watching this
game carefully for about fifteen minutes, and I don’t
believe I thoroughly understand it yet.”</p>


<h2>AW, BE A SPORT, HUBBY</h2>

<p>Mrs. Will Irwin, speaking of women’s wartime costumes,
said at a Washington Square tea:</p>

<p>“The more immodest fashions would disappear if
men would resolutely oppose them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know a woman whose dressmaker sent home the
other day a skirt that was, really, too short altogether.
The woman put it on. It was becoming
enough, dear knows, but it made her feel ashamed.
She entered the library, and her husband looked up
from his work with a dark frown.</p>

<p>“‘I wonder,’ she said, with an embarrassed laugh,
‘if these ultra-short skirts will ever go out?’</p>

<p>“‘They’ll never go out with me,’ he answered in
decided tones.”</p>


<h2>NOT ON THE PROGRAM</h2>

<p>When the wealthy Mrs. Beldon came to visit her
son at his post, the gallant Lieutenant was so pleased
that he arranged a theater party in honor of his
mother. Officers and their ladies were in all the
boxes. When the Lieutenant glanced over the audience
he saw that every one was looking at his box.
Women held handkerchiefs to their faces and men
shook with laughter. Then he noticed that his
mother, who held in one gloved hand a fan, rested
the other arm upon the rail of the box. Her free
hand, she thought, reposed on the lower rail, but
in reality it rested upon the bald pate of an old man
who sat in the box below. The old gentleman apparently
was in agony, but he was very patient.
Suddenly the audience started to applaud and the
officer’s mother, in total abstraction, affectionately
patted that poor bald head, which suddenly arose
in crimson rage and left the theater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<h2>WHERE HIS AUTHORITY BEGAN</h2>

<p>A tired column of troops clambered down a rocky
ledge and went into camp beside a delightful little
pool of water. The commanding officer immediately
placed his sentry at the pool. Soon more soldiers
scrambled down the ledge and a tired Lieutenant
quickly prepared for a plunge into that pool. But
he was met with a sharp command from across the
pond:</p>

<p>“Halt!”</p>

<p>“What are your orders?” said the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Sir,” came the answer, “my orders are to prevent
all officers, soldiers, and natives from bathing in
that pool. The water is reserved for the coffee for
supper.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me before I stripped?”</p>

<p>“Sir, I have no orders to prevent any man from
stripping.”</p>


<h2>A TENNYSONIAN TODDY</h2>

<p>It was bitterly cold. Captain Price was officer
of the day. It was necessary for him to inspect the
guard after midnight, and, fearful of the influenza,
he sought prevention in hot toddy. Fate decreed
that he should be reported drunk on duty. Now,
the men in the troop thought much of their genial
Captain. They petitioned McSweeny, orderly to
the troop commander, to go to the court-martial
and swear to anything, but to be sure to clear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Captain. So it came to pass that McSweeny appeared
as a witness. The Judge Advocate said he
must swear to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. Then he thundered:</p>

<p>“Do you know the accused?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir,” came the answer, “he is my troop
commander, Captain Price.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the accused on this date?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>

<p>“What was the condition of the accused?”</p>

<p>“The Captain was sober, Sir.”</p>

<p>“The testimony reads that he was intoxicated.”</p>

<p>“No, Sir.”</p>

<p>“It is further stated that you helped the accused
to his quarters.”</p>

<p>“No, Sir; I went over to the quarters with the
Captain.”</p>

<p>“It is said that you helped the accused into his
bunk.”</p>

<p>“No, Sir: I took off his boots.”</p>

<p>“Did the accused say anything that would lead
you to suspect that he was intoxicated?”</p>

<p>“No, Sir; he only said one thing.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“When I was leaving, Sir, he said: ‘McSweeny,
call me early. I am going to be Queen of the May.’”</p>


<h2>WHY REMIND THEM OF IT?</h2>

<p>Terry O’Neill was steward on an army transport.
Before the mess call sounded Terry always visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the different staterooms. Pushing the door ajar,
he would say to the officers: “Gentlemen, do you
wish me to throw your luncheon overboard, or will
you do it yourselves?”</p>


<h2>HE’D HEARD HER SING</h2>

<p>“And did you have a good crossing?” asked the
friend of the adventurous lady who had just returned
from France.</p>

<p>“Oh, a most terrible crossing, terrible. The most
awful storm I’ve ever been in. Yet I wasn’t a bit
afraid. The other passengers were in a panic running
all over the boat, till at last the captain, who
had heard that I was a singer, asked me to sing to
them and quiet them, and I did. And all the time I
was singing the heavy seas were running.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame ’em!” growled her father. “I
don’t blame those heavy seas a bit.”</p>


<h2>WHY FRANCE WON</h2>

<p>A Frenchwoman was torn by a shell while rendering
service to the soldiers, and General Petain, of
the French Armies, accompanied by his staff and by
General Pershing as a guest, went to the woman’s
bedside and pinned on her breast the Croix de Guerre,
the soldiers’ cross of war.</p>

<p>“My general,” said the woman to Petain, “I am
glad to have been struck so that you may see and
know that the daughters as well as the sons of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
are ready to suffer and, if need be, to die for France
and for her liberty.”</p>


<h2>MUCH THE SAFEST PLAN</h2>

<p>A recruiting sergeant stationed in the south of
Ireland met Pat and asked him to join the army.
The latter refused, whereupon the sergeant asked
his reason for refusing.</p>

<p>“Aren’t the King and the Kaiser cousins?” asked
Pat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the recruiting sergeant.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pat, “begorra, I once interfered in
a family squabble, and I’m not going to do so again.”</p>


<h2>THE OLD FAMILIAR WORDS</h2>

<p>Some time ago, when a British corps was reviewed
by Sir Ian Hamilton, one officer was mounted on a
horse that had previously distinguished itself in a
bakery business. Somebody recognized the horse,
and shouted, “Baker!” The horse promptly stopped
dead, and nothing could urge it on.</p>

<p>The situation was getting painful when the officer
was struck with a brilliant idea, and remarked, “Not
today, thank you.” The procession then moved on.</p>


<h2>WITH A COMMA AFTER “RED”</h2>

<p>“Mrs. Bing’s new baby is just in the fashion.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It is such a red cross affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<h2>HOLES CLEAR THROUGH HIM</h2>

<p>The melancholy youth was lying in the hospital
bed entertaining his visitors with tales of the battlefield.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, almost tearfully, “I have had a
rough time. I was once so riddled with bullets the
fellows behind me complained of the draft.”</p>


<h2>WAS THIS FOREORDAINED?</h2>

<p>The Presbyterians are having their day, it seems,
if one looks over a list of the foremost men of today.
Woodrow Wilson is a Presbyterian elder; Robert
Lansing, Secretary of State, is likewise. Thomas
R. Marshall, Vice President of the United States,
is a Presbyterian; and so are General Pershing, in
command of America’s legions abroad; General Peyton
C. March, the new Chief of Staff; and General
Hugh Scott. General Field Marshal Haig, of the
British armies, is a member of the Church of Scotland,
which is Presbyterian; and Field Marshal Joffre
is a member of the Reformed Church, which in France
is similarly nearest to the Presbyterian Church in
the United States.</p>


<h2>WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE</h2>

<p>A Tommy on furlough entered a jeweler’s shop
and, placing a much-battered gold watch on the
counter, said, “I want this ’ere mended.”</p>

<p>After a careful survey the watchmaker said, “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
afraid, sir, the cost of repairing will be double what
you gave for it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that,” said the soldier. “Will you
mend it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the jeweler, “at the price.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Tommy, smiling, “I gave a
German a punch on the nose for it, and I’m quite
ready to give you two if you’ll mend it.”</p>


<h2>WAR’S COMPENSATIONS</h2>

<p>“Lady (young) will gladly <small>MARRY</small> and give up
life to the care and happiness of <small>WOUNDED HERO</small>,
blinded or incapacitated by the war.—<i>Genuine, Box
M 770, the London Times.</i>”</p>


<h2>CAP WAS A SURE WINNER</h2>

<p>The captain of the SS. Piffle listened patiently
to a passenger’s account of his shooting abilities,
then he quietly remarked:</p>

<p>“I don’t think you could hit this bottle at twenty
yards, placed on the taffrail, while the ship is heaving
like this.”</p>

<p>“It would be only child’s play,” said the passenger.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet you a guinea you don’t hit it three
times out of six.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wager. Come along.”</p>

<p>The bottle was placed in position. Crack! The
passenger hit it, and it disappeared in fragments
into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Trot out another one,” said the marksman.</p>

<p>“Not at all. The conditions were that you hit
that one three times out of six. Five shots more.”</p>


<h2>ONLY A RUSE AFTER ALL</h2>

<p>The called-up one volubly explained that there
was no need in his case for a medical examination.</p>

<p>“I’m fit and I want to fight. I want to go over
on the first boat. I want to go right into the front
trenches, but I want to have a hospital close, so
that if I get hit no time will be wasted in taking me
where I can get mended right away, so that I can
get back to fighting without losing a minute. Pass
me in, doctor. Don’t waste any time on me. I want
to fight, and keep fighting!”</p>

<p>The doctor, however, insisted, and, when he got
through, reported a perfect physical specimen.</p>

<p>“You don’t find nothing wrong with me, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“But, doctor, don’t you think I’m a bit crazy?”</p>


<h2>TRY IT ON THE YANKS</h2>

<p>She—“Yes, sir, I believe that woman’s place in
this war is right beside the men on the battle line.”</p>

<p>He—“And suppose a commander sent a party of
six men and six women out in the woods to see if the
enemy were in sight, would you call that war? That
would be a picnic!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h2>HER MEASURE OF SUCCESS</h2>

<p>He—“And how are you getting on with your
collecting for the soldiers?”</p>

<p>She—“Splendidly! I’ve had my name in the papers
four times already.”</p>


<h2>BETTER MAKE AN OMELET</h2>

<p>“I’ll put you in the commissary department if
you’ll answer the following question: What would
you do if you had one hundred soldiers and only
ninety-nine eggs?”</p>

<p>“I’d shoot one of the soldiers!”</p>


<h2>THE USUAL PREFERENCE</h2>

<p>That the British “Tommy” is as ready with his
tongue as with his gun was aptly shown the other
day when a number of wounded soldiers were being
admitted to a hospital.</p>

<p>One of the patients was being carried to a ward
named L, but at the door the stretcher bearers were
met by the Sister in charge, who said, “I’m sorry,
but L’s full.”</p>

<p>“All right,” cheerily replied the irrepressible
“Tommy,” “we’ll just go to ’eaven.”</p>


<h2>NOTHING TO FIGHT FOR</h2>

<p>Jem—“Why don’t you shoulder a gun?”</p>

<p>Ben—“Ah ain’t got nothin’ against nobody in
dis here world, and if I have I forgive ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Jem—“But your country is at war and you’ve
got to carry a gun.”</p>

<p>Ben—“Man, the only time Ah carry a gun is when
I’m after one lone man and not after an army!”</p>

<p>Jem—“But why don’t you fight for your country?”</p>

<p>Ben—“Ah live in the city!”</p>


<h2>BOTH UP AND DOWN, AUNTIE</h2>

<p>Aunt Nancy was visiting an army camp and as
she approached some rookies were sitting on their
heels and then rising to a standing position in perfect
unison.</p>

<p>“What are the boys doing now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, those are the setting-up exercises,” explained
an obliging sergeant.</p>

<p>“Humph,” remarked auntie. “Looks to me more
like settin’ down exercises.”</p>


<h2>SECURING A TEMPORARY DIVORCE</h2>

<p>There is a man in Bozeman, Mont., who will probably
go through life bewailing the injustice of the
draft board that certified him for service, despite
the fact that he presented a letter written by his
wife to prove that he had a dependent family. Here
is the letter:</p>

<p>“Dear United States Army: My husband ast me
to write a reckomend that he supports his famly.
He can not read so dont tell him. Jus take him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
He ain’t no good to me. He aint done nothing but
play a fiddle and drink lemmen essense since I married
him, eight years ago, and I got to feed seven
kids of his. Maybe you can get him to carry a gun.
He’s good on squirrels and eatin’. Take him and
welcum. I need the grub and his bed for the kids.
Don’t tell him this but take him.”</p>


<h2>REMINDS ONE OF PLATTSBURG</h2>

<p>“Now, Lieutenant Tompkins,” said the general,
“you have the battalion in quarter column, facing
south—how would you get it into line, in the quickest
possible way, facing northeast?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the lieutenant, after a moment’s
fruitless consideration, “do you know, that’s what
I’ve often wondered.”</p>


<h2>MONOLOGUE, BY NAT M. WILLS</h2>

<p>(As delivered in Chicago.)</p>

<p>I just asked a policeman the quickest way to the
hospital. He told me to go down to Jefferson street
and yell hurrah for the czar. John D. Rockefeller
wants to go to the front, but I don’t think he’ll do
much for the country. When the officer says advance
he’ll raise the price of gasoline.</p>

<p>You know all that peace talk is over. The peace
party crawled into a hole and pulled the hole in
after them—they’re afraid of the draft.</p>

<p>Some men are born soldiers, others develop into
fighters after they marry. I’ve been in four battles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The very first night I was married my wife broke
this news to me. “You know, dear, I can’t dress
myself,” so I got her a French maid; and, “I can’t
drive my own car,” so I got her a chauffeur. Then
she said: “You know I walk in my sleep,” so I had
to get her a night watchman.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam is preparing all right in a hundred
different ways we know nothing about. A man who
comes up to you on the street may be an officer.
If you get a drink in Kansas City, well, that’s secret
service.</p>

<p>It certainly was pretty windy around the Masonic
temple today. You know two girls were passing;
one had red, white and blue stockings on and the
other green; they were going in the opposite direction.
I didn’t know which to look at, but decided
to see America first.</p>

<p>Sousa and I got together a couple of seasons ago.
His band was going to play my songs. I met him
the other day just as I was going into a saloon. He
said: “Nat, my band of 300 men will accompany
you.” I said: “That’s all right with me, Phil, but
do you think there’ll be room?”</p>


<h2>PARDONABLE MISTAKE</h2>

<p>Captain Jones was a very round-shouldered and
eccentric officer.</p>

<p>On a particularly dark night in Egypt, while
practicing his company in outpost duty, he approached
one of the sentries who failed to halt him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>In a great rage the officer demanded of the now
trembling sentry the reason why he had omitted to
challenge him.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” stuttered the confused soldier,
“I thought you was a camel.”</p>


<h2>HE WAS REAL MAD ABOUT IT</h2>

<p>Two privates met the other morning near the canteen,
which, from the fact that a monkey was kept
on the counter, was popularly known as the “Monkey
House.”</p>

<p>“Halloa, Jack,” said the first. “You look a bit
off this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bill,” replied Jack. “I haven’t the price of
a wet.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I,” replied Bill; “but I think I
know how to get a couple of pints. Come into the
Monkey House.”</p>

<p>They entered the canteen and Bill called for two
pints. While the barman’s back was turned Bill hit
the monkey a clout on the head, which caused the animal
to scream out.</p>

<p>“What was that for?” asked the barman, wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Not the first time he has done that,” shouted Bill,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Done what?” asked the barman.</p>

<p>“Why, picked up my shilling and swallowed it,”
replied Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said the indignant barman, “why didn’t
you tell me before you hit the monkey? There’s
your two pints and your sevenpence change. And
don’t you interfere with my monkey again.”</p>


<h2>HE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE</h2>

<p>The scene was a cinema palace, as they call ’em
in England, where the Somme battle-pictures were
being flickered.</p>

<p>As the Warwickshires were seen going over the
top to the attack, an excited Birmingham man exclaimed,
triumphantly: “What about your Highland
regiments now?”</p>

<p>As luck would have it, there was a short, bandy-legged
Scot in a kilt within hearing.</p>

<p>He flared up and replied: “What about oor
Hielant regiments? Why, they are keepin’ back
the Germans while your men are gettin’ their photographs
took.”</p>


<h2>JUST A BIT OF TRENCH REPARTEE</h2>

<p>Australian Soldier (to American)—“You Yanks
think you’ve done a lot, but you forget we Australians
have been at the game for four years.”</p>

<p>“Well, what have you done, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Done? We’ve been at Gallipoli, Mesopotamia,
the plains of Bethlehem, and——”</p>

<p>“The plains of Bethlehem?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I slept a week there myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess that was a busy week for the shepherds
watching their flocks!”</p>


<h2>NOT MENTIONABLE IN SOCIETY</h2>

<p>“I know you have pet names for the big guns,
but what do you call the shells?”</p>

<p>“Depends, ’ow close you are to where they burst,
mum!”</p>


<h2>NOW SHE KNOWS WHY</h2>

<p>She had intently watched the soldier for some
time. Then she ventured: “The chin strap, I suppose,
is to keep your hat on, my man?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Yank, “it’s to rest the jaw after
answering questions.”</p>


<h2>INTERCEPTED WAR MESSAGES</h2>

<p>A wire from Secretary of War Baker: “Discuss
no war news in front of horses. They carry tails.”</p>

<p>Cable from King George to the President: “Send
me over 5,000 sewing machines, we want to hem the
Germans on the border.”</p>

<p>From King George: “Must have $5,000,000; if
it can’t be had any other way get it from the waiters
at the Waldorf.”</p>

<p>Stone wires: “If war breaks out I’ll stand behind
the army.”</p>

<p>Cable from Russian general: “Over a million
pairs of pajamas at once; Russian army ready to
retire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Wire from Empress of Germany to Queen Mary
(sent collect): “Am sitting on my veranda crocheting;
would like to have you join me—Nit.”</p>

<p>From the Czar of Russia: “It’s pretty tough to
be seated on the throne one minute and thrown on
your seat the next.”</p>


<h2>WHAT MOTHERS ALWAYS SAY</h2>

<p>“Remember, my son,” said his mother as she bade
him good-by, “when you get to camp try to be punctual
in the mornings, so as not to keep breakfast
waiting.”</p>


<h2>FASHION NOTE FROM THE FRONT</h2>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked one rookie of another.</p>

<p>“Going to the blacksmith shop to get my tin hat
reblocked.”</p>


<h2>ONE GERMAN WE FORGIVE</h2>

<p>The following story which is going the rounds of
the Continental papers, including even those of Austria,
must make the Germans gnash their teeth.</p>

<p>A German and a Dane met recently in Schiller’s
house in Weimar. As they stood gazing reverently
on the scene the German, swelling with pride, remarked
to his fellow-visitor:</p>

<p>“So this is where our national poet, Schiller,
lived.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the other; “not national, but
international.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked the German, with surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, consider his works,” the Dane replied.
“He wrote, ‘Mary Stuart’ for the English, ‘The
Maid of Orleans’ for the French, ‘Egmont’ for the
Dutch, ‘William Tell’ for the Swiss—”</p>

<p>“And what did he write for the Germans, pray?”
broke in the other. Pat came the Dane’s answer:</p>

<p>“For the Germans he wrote, ‘The Robbers.’”</p>


<h2>EQUINE “NOW I LAY ME”</h2>

<p>Tommy (to the “charger” he has borrowed during
a week-end leave after it has been down three times
in ten minutes)—Wot! On yer knees agen? Go
on—get on with it—“Bless Pa and Ma an’ make me
a good ’orse. Amen.”</p>


<h2>ONE BRITISH ATROCITY</h2>

<p>The “Swanky” One—“I’m smoking a terrible lot
of cigars lately.”</p>

<p>The Other (with conviction)—“You’re right, if
that’s one of them!”</p>


<h2>NEVER MIND THE NAME</h2>

<p>How to pronounce some of the names of the towns
which the Americans get into puzzles the boys, so
they have their own pronunciation. Thus, when they
captured Seringes, it became Syringe, and Fismes became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Fiz. When Fismettes was taken, the battalion
commander went back to report, made several assaults
upon its pronunciation and finally said:</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t tell you what town it is, but I’ve
taken the damned place, anyhow.”</p>


<h2>FRENCH IN THE TRENCH</h2>

<p>Tommy (to Jock, on leave)—“What about the
lingo? Suppose you want to say ‘egg’ over there,
what do you say?”</p>

<p>Jock—“Ye juist say ‘Oof.’”</p>

<p>Tommy—“But suppose you want two?”</p>

<p>Jock—“Ye say, ‘Twa oofs,’ and the silly auld
fule wife gies ye three, and ye juist gie her back
one. Man, it’s an awfu’ easy language.”</p>


<h2>SCOTCH PROVISIONS</h2>

<p>Captain John Stevenson met a recent arrival from
the “auld countree” and speedily got into a chat
with him over conditions there. The new arrival
told feelingly of the terrible toll of war on the fair
land of Scotia, the sad tales of young men killed
and maimed, the sufferings of the families left behind.
His was a right sad tale in every way.</p>

<p>“Wy, man, we’re jist plum distrackit wi’ it,” he
concluded.</p>

<p>“And I suppose the war has caused the price of
provisions to go up in Scotland as well as everywhere
else?” commented Captain Stevenson with sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, man, ye’re richt,” agreed the visitor. “Proveesions
have gone up saxpence the bottle.”</p>


<h2>VERY LIKE MOSES</h2>

<p>The conditions in the trenches were dreary in the
extreme after the drenching and long-continued
rainfall, but the irrepressible spirits of the “Pals”
were not yet entirely quenched when the order came
to leave the trenches.</p>

<p>“Hurry up out of this, my gallant soldiers,” was
the cheery call of the sergeant to his waist-deep and
rain-sodden men.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” came the derisive answer from one of
them. “I’m not a soldier; I’m a blooming bulrush!”</p>


<h2>THEY FIXED YOU, WILLIE</h2>

<p>“We played fool,” declared the Crown Prince “I
see it now.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“We had the whole world to pick a fight with.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“And look at the crowd we picked out.”</p>


<h2>SAFETY FIRST</h2>

<p>Messages had come to the office of a great illustrated
paper that Zeppelins were approaching London.</p>

<p>The editor at once summoned his staff of photographers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, boys, we’ve got to have a picture of this
Zepp. We were badly beaten on the last. The moment
it approaches I want every man to rush to the
roof with his camera and stay there, whatever happens,
until he gets a picture. Let me know directly
you get it. You’ll find me under the heap of coal
bags in the right-hand corner of the lower cellar!”</p>


<h2>NO SUGAR IN HEAVEN</h2>

<p>First Tommy (as he reads the local paper sent
from home)—“O, Bill, what do you think of it?
They’re issuing a list in Blighty of the people what
are going to do without using any more sugar!”</p>

<p>Second Tommy (eagerly grasping the paper and
straining his eyes to find the list of names)—“Where
did you see, it Harry?”</p>

<p>First Tommy—“Why, there” (pointing to the
death column).</p>


<h2>YOU CAN’T DO THIS IN BATTLE</h2>

<p>The military maneuvered. All the afternoon the
attackers had attacked and the defenders defended,
with conspicuous lack of incident or bravery. Operations
were beginning to drag horribly when the white
flag went up.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the attackers stared in
amazement.</p>

<p>“A flag of truce!” he exclaimed. “What do they
want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The sergeant-major endeavored to cover up a
smile.</p>

<p>“They say, sir,” he reported, “that, as it’s tea
time, they’d like to exchange a couple o’ privates
for a can of condensed milk—if you can afford it.”</p>


<h2>NOW IT’S “ALL DUNN”</h2>

<p>An Irish recruit named Dunn was arranging to let
his friends know where he was when on active service.</p>

<p>“If I go to France,” he said, “I shall sign my letter
F. Dunn; to Egypt, E. Dunn.”</p>

<p>“When the war is over and you come home, what
will you sign?”</p>

<p>“We’re Dunn!”</p>

<p>“Well done,” shouted his friends.</p>


<h2>A LAST FAREWELL</h2>

<p>Private Doolan was six feet three inches in his
socks. Beside him the sergeant on duty was a bantam.</p>

<p>“Head up there, Doolan!” he cried. Doolan
raised his head.</p>

<p>“Up higher,” shouted the little sergeant.</p>

<p>“There, that’s better. Don’t let me see you with
your head down again.”</p>

<p>“Am I to be always like this?” asked Doolan, staring
away above the little man’s head.</p>

<p>“You are.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll say good-bye to ye, sergeant, for I’ll
never see ye again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h2>TOO MODEST BY FAR</h2>

<p>During a camp parade of the buglers recently
an Irish corporal was in charge. He was asked by
the commanding officer if all the buglers were present:
He replied: “No, sorr, wan man absent.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the officer, “go and find him
and ask him what he has to say for himself.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Pat came running back.
“Shure, sorr,” he cried, “and weren’t we a pair of
duffers not to know it? It wor meself. Bedad, sorr,
Oi forgot to call me own name entoirely.”</p>


<h2>ANOTHER WAR CASUALTY</h2>

<p>“You don’t seem to feel so enthusiastic as usual
about speech-making.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Senator Sorghum, “times have
changed and it isn’t so easy for a man in a silk hat
and a frock-coat to stand out before a lot of men
in khaki uniforms or overalls and assert that he is
saving the country all by himself.”</p>


<h2>PREACHER HAD A SCOOP</h2>

<p>An editor in the Far West dropped into church
for the first time in many years. The minister was
in the very heart of the sermon. The editor listened
for a while, and then rushed to his office.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows doing? How about the
news from the seat of war?”</p>

<p>“What news?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, all this about the Egyptian Army being
drowned in the Red Sea. The minister up at the
church knows all about it, and you have not a word
of it in our latest. Bustle round, you fellows, and
get out an extra-special edition.”</p>


<h2>THERE IS TIME FOR BOTH</h2>

<p>One industrious war-gardener is pictured as working
busily and reflecting on the virtue of raising his
own food-supply.</p>

<p>“If everybody grew his own vegetables and ate
less meat,” he soliloquized, “we’d put old Bill on
the bum in a hurry. This is tough work, but I’ll
stick to it if it kills me. I’m with Hoover on this.”</p>

<p>At this point a fine assortment of earthworms
was unearthed. The digger’s reflections immediately
shifted to a shady stream and the final scene shows
him happily fishing.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he reflects to soothe his conscience,
“vegetables or fish; it’s all the same to Mr. Hoover.”</p>


<h2>THEY DO SOUND ALIKE</h2>

<p>“Now,” said the Colonel, looking along the line
of recruits, “I want a good smart bugler.”</p>

<p>At that out stepped a dilapidated fellow who had
a thick stubble of black beard.</p>

<p>“What!” said the colonel, eying him up and down.
“Are you a bugler?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bugler!” said he. “I thought you said
burglar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<h2>NO TIME TO SAY ALL OF IT</h2>

<p>“So,” sobbed Ilma Vladoffovitchskioffsky, “Ivan
Nine-spotski died in battle. You say he uttered my
name as he was dying?”</p>

<p>“Part of it,” replied the returned soldier—“part
of it.”</p>


<h2>NO MAIL TO HADES</h2>

<p>Willie Hohenzollern (after Berlin fell)—“But,
mein friendt, I want to write a letter to papa.”</p>

<p>Yankee Guard—“Nothin’ doin’, Heinie. We
don’t have asbestos stationery around here.”</p>


<h2>MORE TO THE PURPOSE</h2>

<p>Officer—“So you captured a thousand Germans
by just calling across No Man’s Land. What did
you do—promise them a square deal if they surrendered?”</p>

<p>Yankee Private—“No; I promised them a square
meal.”—<i>Life.</i></p>


<h2>WHAT WE MAY EXPECT NOW</h2>

<p>The war was over and the new woman was fully
developed. Gone were the petticoats and faldelals.
Women aimed at being rational in character and
dress.</p>

<p>In such an after-the-war household Mr. Bigboy
was washing out baby’s bottle when his wife came
down dressed for going out.</p>

<p>“Are you going out?” whined Mr. Bigboy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said his wife, patting his cheek. “It’s
the big meeting at the lodge.”</p>

<p>“Then—then,” said the man, and his lips trembled,
“if you’re not in by 11 o’clock I’ll—I’ll go
home to father.”</p>


<h2>EIGHT MILES FOR HIM</h2>

<p>A story is told of a German spy who was captured
within the English lines in France. An English
Tommy was detailed by his commander to march
the German four miles back of the lines and there
shoot him. After marching through mud and water
for four miles, all tired out and rain soaked, the
pair finally reached the four-mile point. The German
was exasperated by this time and blurted: “Vot’s
the idea of marching me four miles through mud and
rain to be shot?”</p>

<p>“My word,” the English Tommy said. “What are
you kicking about? Think of me. I gotta walk
back!”</p>


<h2>NO FIGHTING FOR HIM</h2>

<p>One of the recruiting canvassers in an English
provincial town was a well-known magistrate. In
most cases he succeeded in obtaining the promises
he wished, but at last he knocked at one cottage-door
which was opened to him by a sturdy son of
the soil.</p>

<p>“My man,” said the magistrate, in his most persuasive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tones, “are you willing to fight for your
King and country?”</p>

<p>“No, I beant, sir,” was the prompt reply. “An’
I be surprized at you askin’ me for to do it. Two
years ago come next month you yourself fined I
twenty shillings for fighting wi’ Bill Smith, and you
said it wor wicked to fight, an’ I promised you as
I wouldn’t repeat the offense, an’ allus kept my
word.”</p>


<h2>HOW HUNS TICKLED THEMSELVES</h2>

<p>Berlin, April—There is no question that terrible
damage was caused in London by the latest Zeppelin
raid. The commander of the Zeppelin L-10 has
brought back with him to Germany a sketch which
he made while he was flying over the British metropolis.
It clearly shows the houses of Parliament in
flames and Sir Edward Grey running along Piccadilly
with his coat-tails afire. The sketch has been
warmly commended by art and military critics.</p>


<h2>’TWASN’T HIS FAULT</h2>

<p>An English girl gave General Pershing quite a
jolt while he was in London. She had been placed
at his disposal as the driver of his automobile. One
day he said to his girl driver:</p>

<p>“Can you please come for me here at the War
Office at 6 o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, General,” answered the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>At six o’clock, military-like, the General was on
the steps awaiting his car.</p>

<p>At three minutes past six it swung to the curb. The
General, with his eyes a-twinkle, said to the girl, as
he took out his watch: “You are three minutes late.”</p>

<p>“That should hardly count with you, General,”
was the instant answer. “You are three years late.”</p>


<h2>VERY GOOD, PUNCH</h2>

<p>A Chertsey pig-breeder has been granted total
exemption. The pen, it seems, is still mightier than
the sword.—<i>Punch.</i></p>


<h2>HE KNEW ABOUT COWS</h2>

<p>Mrs. Parker—“Now, young man, why aren’t you
at the Front?”</p>

<p>Young Man (milking cow)—“’Cos there ain’t
any milk that end, missus!”</p>


<h2>WILLING TO TREAT</h2>

<p>Examining Surgeon—“Have you any scars?”</p>

<p>Rookie Marine Applicant—“No, sir; but I have
some cigarets in my coat over there.”</p>


<h2>AND FULL OF TABASCO</h2>

<p>“Are they seasoned troops?”</p>

<p>“They ought to be. They were first mustered in
by their officers, and then peppered by the enemy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h2>CAUSE FOR DEPRESSION</h2>

<p>“No, my ’usband ain’t killed, Mrs. Marks. No
sooner did I put all the kids in mournin’, even to
Biby in the pram, when I gets a telegram a sayin’
’e’s alive and well. Yes, an’ all this expense for
nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Wot a crool shame!”</p>


<h2>ENOUGH TO WARRANT EXEMPTION</h2>

<p>Recruiting Officer—“How about joining the
colors? Have you anyone dependent on you?”</p>

<p>Motorist—“Have I? There are two garage owners,
six mechanics, four tire dealers, and every gasoline
agent within a radius of 125 miles.”</p>


<h2>CHANGED HIS TUNE</h2>

<p>Cockney Tommy (surveying fat German soldier
who, being brought in a prisoner, still has his hands
up): “Blow me if this ain’t the old blighter who
used to play, ‘I fear no foe in shining armor’ dahn ahr
street.”</p>


<h2>FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW</h2>

<p>It is, of course, well known that Sir Douglas Haig
is a soldier first, last and all the time, regarding all
other professions as of quite negligible importance,
a trait in his character which lends point to the
anecdote.</p>

<p>He was, it appears, inspecting a cavalry troop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and was particularly struck with the neat way in
which repairs had been made in some of the saddles.</p>

<p>“Very good work,” he remarked to the troop sergeant-major.
“Who did it?”</p>

<p>“Two of my troopers, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You’re fortunate to have two such expert saddlers
in your troop,” said Haig.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, sir,” was the reply, “they’re
not saddlers, in civil life being lawyers.”</p>

<p>“Well,” ejaculated Sir Douglas, “how men who
can do work like that could have wasted their lives
over law I can’t imagine!”</p>


<h2>THOSE PET NAMES FOR OFFICERS</h2>

<p>A very tall, thin lieutenant reported in Flanders
to a Canadian battalion commanded by a bald, elderly
colonel. After a few days he approached his commander
and asked permission to air a grievance.</p>

<p>“I wish you would use your influence, sir, to restrain
my platoon from referring to me as ‘Legs,’”
he said.</p>

<p>“Sure, my lad, sure,” replied the Colonel solemnly,
“if you’ll use yours to stop my whole battalion calling
me ‘Old Baldy.’”</p>


<h2>TOO MUCH HARVARD</h2>

<p>“That ’ere Yank’s an educated toff from ’arvard,”
said Tommy Atkins, leaning on his spade. “I’m jolly
well weary of ’is learnin’, too, that I am. We’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ordered to throw up trenches along the Marne, and
as ’e picks up ’is spade, th’ bloomin’ college blighter
says, says ’e: ‘Well, Tommy, come on; it looks
like we’re infra dig!’ And wot I says is: Blarst a
college education, anyhow, eh?”</p>


<h2>WOULDN’T INSULT THE JACK</h2>

<p>On a road in Belgium a German officer met a boy
leading a jackass, and addressed him in heavy jovial
fashion as follows:</p>

<p>“That’s a fine jackass you have, my son. What
do you call it?... Albert, I bet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, officer,” the boy replied quickly. “I think
too highly of my King.”</p>

<p>The German scowled and returned: “I hope you
don’t dare to call it William.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, officer. I think too highly of my jackass.”</p>


<h2>ONE WAY TO GET EVEN</h2>

<p>Here is a story our wounded boys have brought
back from the front about Sir Douglas Haig.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas was in a great hurry to get to a certain
place. He found his car, but the chauffeur was
missing. So Sir Douglas got in the car and drove
off by himself. Then the driver appeared and saw
the car disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p>“Great Scot!” cried the driver, “there’s ’Aig
a-driving my car!”</p>

<p>“Well, get even with him,” said a Tommy, standing
by, “and go and fight one of ’is battles for him.”</p>

<h2>WILLING TO EXPLAIN</h2>

<p>Staff Colonel—“Your reports should be written
in such manner that even the most ignorant may
understand them.”</p>

<p>Sergeant—“Well, sir, what part is it that you
don’t understand?”</p>


<h2>CAUSE FOR ANNOYANCE</h2>

<p>The latest example of English as she is spoken
comes from Egypt, where a native interpreter, who
had overstayed his leave, wrote the following letter
to his chief:</p>

<p>“My absence is impossible. Someone has removed
my wife. My God, I am annoyed.”</p>


<h2>SHE KNEW HIS MERITS</h2>

<p>Her son had enlisted, and she was a proud old
woman as she harangued a knot of friends on the
village street. “Jarge always done ’is duty by me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
’e did, an’ now ’e’s doin’ ’is duty by King an’ country,”
she said. “I feel right down sorry for them
Germans, to think of ’im goin’ into battle with ’is
rifle in ’is ’and and ‘It’s a Long Way to Tipperary’
on ’is lips.”</p>

<p>“Poor Germans, indeed!” exclaimed one of the
audience. “Pity’s wasted on ’em! P’r’aps you
’aven’t ’eard of their cruelties?”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps I ’aven’t,” agreed the old lady. “An’
p’raps you ’aven’t ’eard Jarge sing.”</p>


<h2>CENSORING THE CLOUDS</h2>

<p>Rural Constable—“Sketching the harbor is forbidden,
sir.”</p>

<p>Artist—“Oh, that’s all right. I’m making a study
of clouds.”</p>

<p>Rural Constable (impressively)—“Ah, but supposin’
your picture got into the hands of the enemy’s
aircraft department, see the use they could make of
it!”—<i>Punch.</i></p>


<h2>IT CAN’T BE DONE</h2>

<p>All this talk of hyphenated citizenship has evidently
had its effect upon a San Francisco youngster,
American-born, who recently rebelled fiercely
when his Italian father whipped him for some misdemeanor.</p>

<p>“But, Tommaso, your father has a right to whip
you when you are bad,” someone of the family said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Tommaso’s eyes flashed. “I am a citizen of the
United States,” he declared. “Do you think I am
going to let any foreigner lick me?”</p>


<h2>A TWO-BIT HERO</h2>

<p>“I’m going to decorate you for bravery, Mr.
Wadleigh. Put this French war-orphan medal on
your coat.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t performed any deed of heroism.”</p>

<p>“But you will when you give up twenty-five cents.”</p>


<h2>ONE OF THE FEW THAT HAVE</h2>

<p>“Can you tell me,” said the Court, addressing
Enrico Ufuzzi, under examination at Union Hill,
N.J., as to his qualifications for citizenship, “the
difference between the powers and prerogatives of
the King of England and those of the President of
the United States?”</p>

<p>“Yezzir,” spoke up Ufuzzi promptly. “King, he
got steady job.”</p>


<h2>HOWL INDEFINITELY POSTPONED</h2>

<p>One of the good stories in circulation is told by
Joe Tumulty, secretary to the President. He likes
his job, but he dislikes one thing about it: that he
can’t tell the boys—the friendly reporters—about all
they wish to know. He illustrated his inability to
give information once by quoting the case of Johnny.</p>

<p>Johnny was crying in the hall as his mother came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
along, hatted and coated. She asked what had happened.</p>

<p>“You are going away; and so is papa!” Johnny
sobbed.</p>

<p>“Why, child, I shall be away two or three days, but
father is not going away!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is!” cried Johnny. “He’s going to
Rome.”</p>

<p>“Rome? What do you mean, dear?” asked the
surprised mother.</p>

<p>“He said today to Mr. Brown that he would make
Rome howl when you left!”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Well, dear, I sha’n’t leave you now.”</p>


<h2>AND THEY DRINK GRAPE JUICE</h2>

<p>A torpedo with a corkscrew course has been observed.
If it misses the port side it turns and strikes
the starboard; sometimes on missing there it even
turns again, striking the port side. The ship’s officer
unaccountably omitted to add that after the explosion
the fragments reunite and return to the submarine
as a complete missile ready to be fired anew.—<i>New
York Sun.</i></p>


<h2>LESS METERS, LESS GAS</h2>

<p>John—“The French have gained four hundred
meters from the enemy.”</p>

<p>Auntie—“How splendid! That should help to
put a stop to those dreadful gas-attacks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<h2>YOU KNOW THAT PAPER</h2>

<p>First War Correspondent—“Did your dispatch get
past the censor?”</p>

<p>Second War Correspondent—“Only the part that
wasn’t true.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that all your paper wants?”—<i>Life.</i></p>


<h2>CHANCE TO GET EVEN</h2>

<p>“Footlyte actually seemed pleased at leaving a
$300-per-week theatrical engagement to serve as a
$30-per-month sergeant in France.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Three dramatic critics are privates in
his company.”</p>


<h2>THE WAY THINGS LOOKED IN 1916</h2>

<p>“Before I left the United States,” said Col. George
Harvey in London, “I agreed with a Columbia professor
who said preponderant power in men and
money was bound to win the war; but now I have a
stronger argument—one which fell from the lips of
a recruiting sergeant in the Strand yesterday.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you want to be on the winning side?’ said
the soldier to a group of civilians who he was suggesting
should don khaki.</p>

<p>“‘How do you know ours will be the winning side?’
asked a prospective recruit.</p>

<p>“‘Well, my lad,’ said the sergeant, ‘you know the
Germans have been trying for more than a year and a
half to win and have failed, don’t you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ replied the questioner.</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, we’ve been trying to lose during the
same period and we couldn’t.’”</p>


<h2>CAUSE FOR REJOICING</h2>

<p>As the regiment was leaving, and a crowd cheering,
a recruit asked: “Who are all those people who are
cheering?”</p>

<p>“They,” replied the veteran, “are the people who
are not going.”—<i>Life.</i></p>


<h2>BUT NOT THIS TIME</h2>

<p>Officer (to boy of thirteen who, in his effort to
get taken on as a bugler, has given his age as sixteen)—“Do
you know where boys go who tell lies?”</p>

<p>Applicant—“To the front, sir.”</p>


<h2>EVIDENCE OF REFINEMENT</h2>

<p>Two fair munition workers were discussing their
personal affairs.</p>

<p>“Got a chap yet, Liz?” inquired one.</p>

<p>“Yes; and he’s a regular toff. He’s manager
at ——.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! Why, they tell me he’s real
refined.”</p>

<p>“Rather! Why, he took me to a restaurant last
week, and when we had coffee he poured it into a
saucer to cool it, but he didn’t blow it like common
people would—he fanned it with his hat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h2>EVENING THINGS UP</h2>

<p>A farmer the other day took a plowshare to the
blacksmith’s to be sharpened, and while the blacksmith
worked the farmer chuckled and bragged about
a sale of hogs he had just made.</p>

<p>“Them hogs was only eight months old,” he said,
“and none too fat, nuther; but I seen that the buyer
was at his wits’ end, and by skillful jugglin’ I boosted
up the price on him just 300 per cent. Yes, by gum,
I got three times more for them hogs than I uster
get before the war.”</p>

<p>The plowshare being done, the farmer handed the
smith 50 cents.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said the smith; “I charge $1.50 for
that job now.”</p>

<p>“You scandalous rascal!” yelled the farmer.
“What do you mean by treblin’ your price on me?
What have you done it for?”</p>

<p>“I’ve done it,” said the blacksmith, “so’s I’ll be
able to eat some of that high-priced pork of yours
this winter.”</p>


<h2>AN INTERIOR PROBLEM</h2>

<p>“Those Germans are certainly efficient,” said
father at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“How so? How?” asked mother.</p>

<p>“Why,” said father, “I see they have put the
whole question of the food supply into the hands of
the Minister of the Interior.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h2>BEEN “GETTING UP” EVER SINCE</h2>

<p>When Gen. Leonard Wood was a small boy he was
called up in the grammar class.</p>

<p>The teacher said: “Leonard, give me a sentence
and we’ll see if we can change it to the imperative
mood.”</p>

<p>“The horse draws the cart,” said Leonard.</p>

<p>“Very good. Now change it to an imperative.”</p>

<p>“Get up!” said young Wood.</p>


<h2>MERELY A WAY-STATION</h2>

<p>“Going to France?” asked a traveling man at the
station of a negro soldier.</p>

<p>“No, sah! I’se not going to France,” replied the
dusky soldier. “I’se goin’ to Berlin, but I may stop
in France for a showt time on de way.”</p>


<h2>OBEYING ORDERS</h2>

<p>He was a new and not very intelligent soldier, and
took Army Regulations very seriously. He was
strolling down the Strand smoking a pipe, when he
was passed by a Brigadier-General. When he failed
to salute, the mighty one pulled him up.</p>

<p>“Why the deuce didn’t you salute me?” he roared.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied the delinquent, secure in the
consciousness of an adequate excuse, “my sergeant
has always taught me never to salute with a pipe in
my mouth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h2>NO ABSENT TREATMENT WANTED</h2>

<p>A party of wounded marines were being taken
to a base-hospital on a much over-crowded motor-truck.
The nurse accompanying them became anxious
about their wounds.</p>

<p>“I hope I am not hurting any of you,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’re hurting me a lot,” replied one of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>“But I am nowhere near you,” exclaimed the
nurse indignantly.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s hurting me,” was the calm reply.</p>


<h2>CAUSE FOR CONFIDENCE</h2>

<p>An English private had captured a German captain.
Tommy marched his prisoner into headquarters
with the air of a major-general on parade and
stood waiting for his turn to deliver over his captive.</p>

<p>The German captain smirked disdainfully, glanced
about the tent, and hissed at Tommy, “You stupid
English, you dink dat you vill vin dis var. Vell, I
tell you dot you von’t, for ve haf the German Gott
on our side.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, old boy,” replied Tommy
promptly, “we’ve got the Yanks on ours.”</p>


<h2>JUST GOT ON TO IT</h2>

<p>Captain: “You say this man called you a hippopotamus
four weeks ago. Why report it now?”</p>

<p>Sergeant: “Because I only seen a hipperpotamus
for the first time yesterday, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h2>READY FOR ANY SNAKE</h2>

<p>“This is no time to talk peace,” declared Representative
Thomas Heflin, of Alabama. “Rather it is
the time to keep on preparing. Germany dragged
us into this war against our will, and now that we are
in it we have to go through with it. We can win this
war in a year beyond doubt, but we have got to keep
going. The United States is in pretty good shape
now, and there is no reason why we should talk peace.</p>

<p>“There was an old fellow down in north Alabama
and out in the mountains; he kept his jug in the hole
of a log. He would go down at sundown to take a
swig of mountain dew—mountain dew that had never
been humiliated by a revenue officer nor insulted by
a green stamp. He drank that liquid concoction that
came fresh from the heart of the corn, and he glowed.
One evening while he was letting the good liquor
trickle down his throat he felt something touch his
foot. He looked down and saw a big rattlesnake
coiled ready to strike.</p>

<p>“The old fellow took another swig of the corn,
and in defiance he swept that snake with his eyes.</p>

<p>“‘Strike, dern you, strike; you will never find me
better prepared.’</p>

<p>“That’s the way I feel about the present situation.”</p>


<h2>DID HE GET HER MEANING?</h2>

<p>“If you refuse to marry me I’ll enlist.”</p>

<p>“What a pity you did not ask me four years ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h2>IT’S THE SHELLS</h2>

<p>Waiter—“Yes, sir; omelets has gone up on account
of the war.”</p>

<p>Diner—“Great Scott! Are they throwing eggs
at each other now?”</p>


<h2>OFFENSIVE PREPARATIONS</h2>

<p>German General—“Have our brave troops been
informed that we shall be in Paris in four days?”</p>

<p>Subordinate—“Yes, General.”</p>

<p>“They understand that the Great War was forced
upon us?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, General.”</p>

<p>“They have been told that the Americans always
kill our machine gunners if they surrender?”</p>

<p>“That is well understood, General.”</p>

<p>“They have been instructed that the few Americans
opposed to us are cowardly and inexperienced?”</p>

<p>“Hand-bills announcing that fact are passed
around each evening.”</p>

<p>“Then let the offensive begin.”</p>


<h2>GETTING BACK AT HEINE</h2>

<p>A German sergeant on the staff of a prison hospital
in Germany, where a number of captured English
officers were being treated, became quite friendly
with the prisoners under his care. One day he told
them that he had been ordered to active service on
the Somme front. He felt convinced that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
be captured by the English, and asked the English
officers if they would not give him some sort of testimonial
which he could show if he were taken prisoner,
so he would not be ill-treated.</p>

<p>The English officers were much amused at this idea,
and concocted a note of introduction, written in English.
The German sergeant knew no English and
could not understand his testimonial, but he tucked
it in his pocket, well satisfied.</p>

<p>In due time he was sent to the Somme front, and
was captured by the “women from hell,” as the Germans
call the Scotch kilties. He at once presented
his note of introduction, and his captors laughed
heartily when they read:</p>

<p>“This is L——. He is not a bad sort of chap.
Don’t shoot him; torture him slowly to death.”</p>


<h2>ZOOLOGICAL MONSTROSITY</h2>

<p>When certain soldiers from the antipodes were in
New York a little while ago, a woman was heard to
say to another:</p>

<p>“There goes one of them Australians.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“You can tell by the Kangaroo feathers in his
hat.”</p>


<h2>NOT WANTED ANYWHERE</h2>

<p>“This can’t be hell—there are no Germans here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is; but the regular people put up such a
kick, we built an annex for them.”—<i>Life.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>


<h2>THERE WAS A PAIR OF THEM</h2>

<p>A private of a well-known regiment, who was
always wanting leave on some excuse or other, applied
at the orderly room and asked his commanding
officer if he might have a few days’ leave, as his wife
was ill and had sent him a letter asking him to come
at once.</p>

<p>But his commanding officer, getting tired of his
always wanting leave, said: “This is strange, Private
Cheek, as only this morning I received a letter from
your wife, saying she did not want you to see her
any more, so hoped I would not grant you leave.”</p>

<p>Private Cheek—“Then I suppose I can’t have
leave, sir?”</p>

<p>Commanding Officer—“No, you cannot.”</p>

<p>Private Cheek (turns as he gets to the door)—“Sir,
may I compliment you?”</p>

<p>Commanding Officer—“Yes, certainly; on what?”</p>

<p>Private Cheek—“In having two such lovely liars
in the regiment, because I’m not married at all.”</p>


<h2>NOT AS INTENDED</h2>

<p>Queen Mary sent a beautiful bouquet that had
been presented to her to a soldiers’ hospital. To
show their appreciation, the inmates commissioned
one of their number to stand at the hospital gate the
following morning, holding the gift, when the queen
passed. He did so—with rather unexpected results.
Queen Mary, seated in her car, saw the soldier standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
there, bouquet in hand, and assuming that he
wished to present it to her, she reached out and took
it. After she had thanked him, her car passed on.</p>

<p>The soldier stood quite dumfounded—then recovering
his speech, he said: “Well, she’s pinched ’em.”</p>


<h2>CHEERING NEWS</h2>

<p>War Correspondent in France—“My editor seems
very disappointed; what news can I send to cheer
him up?”</p>

<p>Soldier—“Write and tell him you’ve been killed
in action.”</p>


<h2>WHY THIS DELAY?</h2>

<p>Ensign Paul Perez, formerly well known to the
screen, is back from another trip to Europe with a
brand new seasick story. An amateur navigator
making his first trip across is the victim and the first
day out he was in the throes of the mal-est mal de mer
extant when the ship surgeon visited him in his stateroom.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” was the latter’s callous
query.</p>

<p>“O-o-oh,” was the only response as the young navy
man rolled over in agony.</p>

<p>“Come, get up,” derided the surgeon, grinning
unfeelingly. “The ship’s been submarined and will
sink in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes?” the sick man protested feebly.
“Can’t you make it any sooner?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<h2>PERHAPS YOU HAVE WONDERED</h2>

<p>A doughboy is an American soldier, and American
soldiers, infantrymen, artillerymen, medical department,
signal corps sharps, officers and men alike, all
are called doughboys. Our cartoonist is one, so is
General Pershing.</p>

<p>The term “doughboys” dates back to the Civil
War when army wit was aroused by large globular
brass buttons on infantry uniforms. Somebody (he
must have been a sailor) dubbed the buttons “doughboys”
because they reminded him of the boiled
dumplings of raised dough served in ships’ messes
and known to all sailors as doughboys. Originally it
referred only to an enlisted infantryman, but the A.
E. F. applies it to all branches and all grades of the
service.—<i>The Stars and Stripes.</i></p>


<h2>NO CREEDS IN WARTIME</h2>

<p>A strict Baptist mother visited her son in one of the
cantonments on a recent Sunday. She was deeply
solicitous that her boy should receive proper religious
instruction.</p>

<p>“Is there a Baptist preacher in camp?” asked the
mother. The son did not know, but he would inquire.
Yes, one was to hold a service that afternoon and give
an address in a Y. M. C. A. hut. The two went and
heard an inspiring address on how Christ is always
the comrade of all men who fight for righteousness,
even when they are not conscious of his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother was delighted and after the service told
the preacher how happy she was that her son could
hear such good Baptist doctrine.</p>

<p>“But, madam,” said the speaker, “I am not a Baptist;
I am an Episcopalian.”</p>

<p>Thus are all denominational lines being battered
down in the camps.</p>


<h2>BUT IT’S MEN WHO PAY THEM</h2>

<p>“It is remarkable that so many women should be
working.”</p>

<p>“Women have always worked,” replied Miss
Cayenne. “The principal difference just now is that
they are working away from home and getting paid
for it.”</p>


<h2>ACQUIRING WIFELY ARTS</h2>

<p>Harold, the only son of a wealthy widowed mother,
was drafted, and duly arrived at the camp where he
was to receive instruction in the manly art of warfare.
Imagine his surprise and chagrin when he was
detailed to what is known as K. P. duty (“Kitchen
police” duty). In this he became quite proficient,
however, as one of his letters shows:</p>

<p>“Dear Mother:—I put in this entire Christmas
day washing dishes, sweeping floors, making beds
and peeling potatoes. When I get home from this
camp I’ll make some girl a mighty fine wife!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE NERVE OF THE COOK</h2>

<p>One mess in the British front line was the envied
of all the neighborhood units because it enjoyed fresh
vegetables every day. The cook was often asked
about it. “We get them from a garden near by,”
he always said. At last the supply ceased. The mess
soon asked why. “We’ve had all there were,” said the
cook, “except a few that were right on the edge of
the Boche trench.” Then it turned out that he had
gone out every night into “No Man’s Land” and
gathered green vegetables from a garden which ran
right down to the German front line.</p>


<h2>FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR</h2>

<p>Sandy and Pat were discussing the war economies
of their respective landladies.</p>

<p>“Indade,” said Pat, “the other day Oi saw that
wumman O’Grady countin’ the paes to put in the
broth.”</p>

<p>“Och,” replied Sandy, “where I am the landlady
melts the margarine an’ paints it on yer bread wi’ a
brush!”</p>


<h2>GIVING THEM A SEND-OFF</h2>

<p>He was a wounded soldier who was traveling in a
train. At a point on the line where it ran parallel
with the road he saw a brand-new territorial battalion
marching up to the front. He stuck his bandaged
head out of the door and yelled, “Are you dahn-hearted?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The Terriers, from the colonel to the
smallest drummer, shouted, “No-o-oh!” The wounded
man replied: “Well, you d—d soon will be when you
get in those trenches.”</p>


<h2>DON’T BELIEVE ALL YOU HEAR</h2>

<p>Private A—“Some funny things hev happened in
this war. I heard of a bloke the other day who lost
his right hand and didn’t know it till he tried to take
a package of fags out of his pocket!”</p>

<p>Private B—“That’s not so bad; but I heard of a
bloke who got his head shot off and didn’t know it
till he tried to scratch it!”</p>


<h2>YOU’VE SEEN THEM</h2>

<p>Dasher—“I don’t believe the war-films we saw last
night were taken at the front.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dasher—“Of course they were; didn’t you
notice the bullet-holes at the end of each reel?”—<i>Puck.</i></p>


<h2>PLACING THE BLAME</h2>

<p>A sergeant and a private were out sniping. The
private was troubled with a cold, and was continually
sneezing, which rather annoyed and put the sergeant’s
shots off their mark.</p>

<p>“Confound you, Coldhead,” yelled the enraged
sergeant at last, “you made me miss again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t do nothing, sergeant,” exclaimed
the private, amazed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, you did. It was your blinkin’ sneeze.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t sneeze,” again protested the private.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t,” roared the sergeant. “It’s
the first bloomin’ time you’ve missed, and—I allowed
for it, you chump!”</p>


<h2>PROOF POSITIVE</h2>

<p>A “Jack Johnson” had exploded with a deafening
roar, and Murphy, wiping his eyes clear of mud with
his respirator, looked round to see Clancy, his chum,
lying very still.</p>

<p>“Spake to me, Terence!” he whispered. “Are ye
alive or dead?”</p>

<p>“Dead!” faintly murmured Clancy.</p>

<p>“What a liar the man is!” soliloquized Murphy,
much relieved.</p>

<p>Then Clancy sat up.</p>

<p>“Ye know I must be dead, Murphy,” he said, “or
it isn’t the likes of you would be calling me a liar!”</p>


<h2>CARBOLIC STARTED THIS</h2>

<p>J. F. Hartz, of Detroit, the dean of the American
Surgical Trade Association, said at the fiftieth annual
convention in New York:</p>

<p>“The war has kited the price of carbolic acid up
to $1.65 a pound—it sold before the war at 9 cents
a pound. The hospitals that use carbolic now have
to be as economical and sparing as old Josh Lee.</p>

<p>“Old Josh Lee was a miser, and he breakfasted
every morning on oatmeal. To save fuel, he cooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his week’s supply of oatmeal on Sundays. This supply,
by the time Saturday came round, was pretty
stiff and tough and hard to down.</p>

<p>“One Saturday morning old Josh found his oatmeal
particularly unappetizing. It had a crust on it
like iron. He took a mouthful of the cold, stiff
mixture—then he half rose, thinking he’d have to
cook himself some eggs.</p>

<p>“But he hated to give in. He hated to waste that
oatmeal. So he took out the whisky-bottle, poured
a generous glass, and setting it before his plate, he
said:</p>

<p>“‘Now, Josh, if you eat that oatmeal you’ll get
this whisky; and if you don’t, you won’t.’</p>

<p>“The oatmeal was hard to consume, but Josh, with
his eye on the whisky, managed it. Then, when the
last spoonful was gone, he grinned broadly, poured
the whisky back into the bottle again, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Josh, my son, I fooled you that time, you old
idiot!’”</p>


<h2>BY JOVE, QUITE RIPPING</h2>

<p>Everybody who has been in Epsom has seen the big
gates on which are perched two stone dogs. An
American officer saw them recently for the first time.</p>

<p>He approached a native with a joke on his lips,
expecting to see it fall flat, as he had been taught
would be the case. “When do they feed these dogs?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“When they bark,” said the Epsomite, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
this particular American is more of an admirer of
Englishmen than ever.</p>


<h2>FROM SANTA CLAUS IN WASHINGTON</h2>

<p>At one stage of the war Uncle Sam’s steamers crossing
the Atlantic had enormous stars and stripes
painted on both sides of their hulls, bow and stern,
and between these flags the space was occupied by
the ship’s name. At night brilliant lights illuminated
the whole gaudy color scheme. A steamer so decorated
was signaled by a British cruiser, “What ship
is that?” The reply came: “United States mail
steamer So-and-So.” Said the cruiser: “Thanks.
Thought you were a Christmas tree out of season.”—London
<i>Opinion</i>.</p>


<h2>THIS BEATS ALL</h2>

<p>A young French officer, speaking of bravery on
the field of battle, tells this story on himself: “I was
in front of my section at night, when suddenly, about
ten feet away, I saw a line of enemy riflemen. I told
my men to lie down. Then I looked closely, and very
clearly made out moving helmets. With my men
behind me we all suddenly arose and charged. I went
ahead and, revolver in hand, I threw myself forward,
shouting in German with all my strength: ‘Surrender!
You are prisoners!’ only to find that we had
charged several rows of beet stalks with their heads
nodding in the wind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h2>PAT WAS STRINGING HIM</h2>

<p>“Well, Pat, my good man, what did you do?”
inquired a patronizing stranger of the Irishman back
in London on leave, with his arm in a sling.</p>

<p>The stranger’s air annoyed Pat, who blandly said:</p>

<p>“Faith, an’ I walked up to one of them an’ cut off
his feet.”</p>

<p>“Cut off his feet! Why not his head?”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ that was already cut off.”</p>


<h2>ANOTHER HUN ATROCITY</h2>

<p>An officer recently on leave brought home and gave
to a lady a bottle of eau de cologne found in a German
colonel’s dugout.</p>

<p>She was at a dinner party shortly afterwards, exhibited
it, and she and other ladies dabbed their faces
with the perfume.</p>

<p>The room became very warm, and soon they were
horrified by the appearance of black stains on their
features.</p>

<p>The stuff was a hair dye, which only developed its
color when heated. The worst of it was the stains
did not disappear for some days.</p>


<h2>KNEW HIM WELL</h2>

<p>First Tommy—“Here’s a nice letter for a fellow to
receive! The scoundrel who wrote it calls me a
blithering idiot.”</p>

<p>Second Tommy—“What’s his name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>First Tommy—“That’s just what I’d like to find
out; but there’s no signature.”</p>

<p>Second Tommy—“Don’t you recognize the writing?
It must be somebody who knows you.”</p>


<h2>ENOUGH TO MAKE A KING LAUGH</h2>

<p>A gallant British officer, granted leave, went to
London to get married, and upon his arrival was
very much astonished to receive a summons from
the King to an “audience” at five o’clock in the
afternoon. He was married at four o’clock, and so,
after the ceremony, he drove to Buckingham Palace,
and said to his bride: “Now, if you will wait in the
carriage I won’t be more than half an hour. These
audiences are always very perfunctory and brief.”</p>

<p>When he was received by the King he found, however,
that he was quite alone, was received most informally,
and that His Majesty was very keen to
know of the officer’s exploits and movements at the
front. Then, before the officer was aware how time
had flown, His Majesty said: “We have dinner in
half an hour and of course you will stay. The ladies
will want to hear your story.”</p>

<p>The officer had not the courage to tell the King
that his bride of an hour had already been waiting in
the carriage for three hours, and so, finding no
chance to send word out to her, he remained for dinner.
The dinner was very leisurely served, there
was much talk about the front, and it was after ten
o’clock when the party broke up. The officer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
on edge to leave, when the King said: “You will
be shown to your room, and tomorrow morning I
shall have something to give you.”</p>

<p>The officer thanked him, and, as he was going to
his room, he called one of the equerries of the household
to him and confided to him his dilemma. Within
five minutes there was a knock at the officer’s door,
and when he opened it the King stood there fairly
convulsed with laughter. “My dear chap,” said the
King, “why didn’t you tell me? Of course it was
hard on you and your lady, but really this is the best
joke I’ve heard for a long time.”</p>

<p>The bride was found, brought in, and under the
King’s and Queen’s graciousness any feelings toward
her new husband and his hosts which she may have
had in her carriage wait of six hours melted away;
and the happy bridal couple spent their marriage
night at Buckingham Palace.</p>


<h2>TOO SLEEPY TO BE SCARED</h2>

<p>All Paris is laughing over the sangfroid of a
young married midinette on the occasion of an air
raid on Paris.</p>

<p>The heroine resides on the top story of a large
apartment house, and when the warning was given
was sound asleep.</p>

<p>The concierge, finding that she did not descend
to the underground shelter, raced upstairs and banged
at the door.</p>

<p>After repeated hammerings he woke the lady up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and called to her to immediately descend to the basement
as a raid was on and she was in great danger on
the top floor.</p>

<p>The reply he got was:</p>

<p>“Go away and let me sleep. My husband is in the
trenches. Do you think he gets into a dugout every
time a shell falls? Why should I, therefore, be
frightened of an air raid?”</p>


<h2>SHE UNDERSTOOD WOMEN</h2>

<p>He wanted to buy a Christmas present for his girl
back home, so that she could show it to all the other
girls, and destroy their peace of mind because it had
come from France. He knew just what he wanted,
too, but every time he thought of going into the shop
and trying to ask in French for the thing he wanted
he got red behind the ears. He had gone over the
top in the past, unafraid, but he couldn’t do this.</p>

<p>At last, when his leave was up, he went into the
canteen and asked the Y. M. C. A. woman there to
make the purchase for him. He gave her the address
and hoped it wouldn’t be too much trouble to send
the package.</p>

<p>“Of course it wouldn’t,” said the Y. M. C. A.
woman, who buys dozens of such gifts each week.
“I’ll enjoy it. I’ll see that the package goes all
right, and, if you like, I’ll write her a little note, too,
telling her how well you’re looking.”</p>

<p>“That will be nice,” said the private. He counted
out the money, a generous amount. Still he lingered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and it was evident that he had something else on his
mind.</p>

<p>“Anything else I can do for you?” asked the
woman.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” began the private, hesitatingly.
He stopped, swallowed, and started all over again.
“Please be careful what you say in that note, won’t
you, ma’am? You see—my girl—she’s funny about
some things—she might think—well, you know how
women are!” finished the private wisely.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said the American woman.
“I’ll tell her I enjoyed meeting you because I have a
son in the army myself. Will that do?”</p>

<p>“That will be fine,” said the private heartily.
“I wouldn’t have mentioned it, only you know how
women are.” He smiled at her understandingly, saluted,
turned and went out.</p>


<h2>WELL, THAT WAS HIS COMPANY</h2>

<p>First Officer—“What was the joke about Lieutenant
Footle?”</p>

<p>Second Officer—“Why, the Major’s wife said she’d
be glad of his company at her house on Wednesday,
and the silly ass took all his men along.”</p>


<h2>SPOIL OF WAR</h2>

<p>The proudest Yankee in the whole advancing
army that entered Saint Mihiel was the driver of a
motor truck who, when he came within five miles of
the town, discovered a little girl, four years old, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a doll in her arms, sitting by the road, crying. The
American immediately stopped the truck, gathered
the little one in with her doll, put her on the seat
of honor at his left, and thus drove into the town, to
the joy of the Yankee soldiers when they discovered
her. No one has claimed the little one and she is
still the mascot of the company, as happy as a lark
and, of course, literally spoiled to death by the worshiping
soldiers, who give her so many sweets that
the poor little one is sick about once a week. Then
the boys take her to the base hospital and, after a
day, she is back again as well as ever.</p>


<h2>CHEERFUL NEWS FROM ‘OVER THERE’</h2>

<p>It’s a shame to do it, but public safety impels us
to expose the sergeant who is palming off his Mexican
border service ribbon as an American croix de
guerre, thereby raising his own holdings of “amourique
Amerique” stock in the eyes of petite Madélon.</p>

for in the rosy days of the future when friend wife

telling her of the great rôle we played in the world-safe-for-democracy

<p>So many Yanks are over here now that there is
scarcely room to house them, thereby creating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
necessity of extending the eastern frontier of this
domain of Foch, Pershing, et al.</p>

<p>To our exchange desk has recently come a copy of
the <i>Kriegszeitung</i>, the official organ of the Seventh
German Army. The most we can say for the sheet
is that it is Boche and bosh.</p>

plan works out in the land of Eskimos, but we suppose
all they have to do is to get up six months earlier

<h2>HE KNEW WHAT TO USE</h2>

<p>A sergeant standing at a window in the barracks
saw a private pass in full-dress uniform, with a bucket
in his hand in the act of fetching water from the
pump.</p>

<p>Sergeant—“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>Private—“To fetch some water, sir.”</p>

<p>Sergeant—“Not in those trousers, surely?”</p>

<p>Private—“No, sir; in the bucket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h2>THEY CAN’T WORK THIS ANY MORE</h2>

<p>A manufacturer in Switzerland who had been in the
habit of purchasing many of his supplies in Germany
before the war recently met a German commercial
traveler with whom he had been accustomed to
trade. The man smilingly offered his wares, but he
was met with a peremptory refusal.</p>

<p>“Is it because I am a German that you refuse to
give me an order?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the Swiss.</p>

<p>“Have you had reason to complain of the way I
have executed your orders in the past? You have
not, have you? Very well, then, if you are friendly
to France that is no reason why you should go against
your own interests. You know very well that the
goods you get of me will cost you at least twice as
much if you buy them of French makers.”</p>

<p>“I know that, but I will make a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>The Boche traveler was not discouraged. “You
are making a mistake,” he remarked. “If you do
business with us I will give you what no one in France
can give you.”</p>

<p>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>“You have no doubt relatives who are French
soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” said the Boche, interrupting him.
“There is, perhaps, one who has the misfortune to be
a prisoner in our country. Give me your usual order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
tell me the name of the prisoner, one, no more, and I
swear to you that I will secure his release as permanently
disabled.”</p>

<p>The salesman was asked to repeat his offer. He
did so, and the merchant said: “Very well; I will try
you to see whether you keep your word.”</p>

<p>“Try me and see,” answered the German.</p>

<p>The manufacturer gave the order so ardently desired,
and furnished the traveler with the name and
address of one of his nephews who was a prisoner in
Prussia. A week later the nephew arrived in Switzerland,
with a number of prisoners who were totally
disabled, astounded at his liberty, because he was perfectly
well!—<i>Ladies’ Home Journal.</i></p>


<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION WANTED</h2>

<p>Officer—“Now, Private Jenkins, I am going to
give you a very responsible job. Under our advanced
trench is a large mine. I want you to stay there,
and when the mine goes up I want you to blow this
whistle. Now, do you clearly understand?”</p>

<p>Private Jenkins—“Well, there’s one thing I’m not
certain of, sir. When do I blow the whistle—going
up or coming down?”</p>


<h2>THAT WAS THE HYMN NUMBER</h2>

<p>A soldier got mixed recently. He tells about it in
a letter home: “They put me in barracks; they took
away my clothes and put me in khaki; they took away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
my name and made me ‘No. 575;’ they took me to
church, where I’d never been before, and they made
me listen to a sermon for forty minutes. Then the
parson said: ‘No. 575, art thou weary, art thou
languid?’ and I got seven days in the guardhouse
because I answered that I certainly was.”</p>

<h2>BOOZE FIGHTERS</h2>

<p>An inquisitive old lady asked a royal defense corps
veteran what the letters “R. D. C.” meant.</p>

<p>“Reformed Drunkards’ Corps, ma’am,” he replied
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” she murmured, “what miracles those
recruiting sergeants do perform!”</p>


<h2>VERY PROPER ANSWER</h2>

<p>A retired army officer tells of an army examiner
who had before him a very dull candidate. The man
proving, apparently, unable to make response to the
most simple questions, the examiner finally grew
impatient and, quite sarcastically, put this question:</p>

<p>“Let it be supposed that you are a captain in command
of infantry. In your rear is an impassable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
abyss. On both sides of you there rise perpendicular
rocks of tremendous height. In front of you lies
the enemy, outnumbering you ten to one. What, sir,
in such an emergency, would you do?”</p>

<p>“I think, sir,” said the aspirant for military distinction,
“I would resign.”</p>


<h2>WHAT DISCOURAGED HIM</h2>

<p>A sergeant was trying to drill a lot of raw recruits,
and after working hard for three hours he
thought they seemed to be getting into some sort of
shape, so decided to test them.</p>

<p>“Right turn!” he cried. Then, before they had
ceased to move, came another order, “Left turn!”</p>

<p>One hoodlum left the ranks and started off toward
the barracks-room.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” yelled the angry sergeant. “Where
are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough,” replied the recruit in a disgusted
tone. “You don’t know your own mind for
two minutes runnin’!”</p>


<h2>GOING SOMEWHERE</h2>

<p>A colored soldier on the fighting front got a two
days’ leave shortly after the signing of the armistice,
and immediately prepared to make a date in the
French capital. When leaving the front, however,
he got held up by a French sentry, who was unable
to understand Sam’s explanations. Sam accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
talked louder and louder, shaking his fist at the
Frenchman, who threatened to shoot if Sam proceeded.
Finally Sam said: “Looka here, boss, I got
a mother in heaven, a father in the other place, and
a sweetheart in Paris, and I’m agoin’ to see one of ’em
tonight.”</p>


<h2>OUTRANKED IN THE KITCHEN</h2>

<p>The son of the well-to-do family had recently
joined up as a private, and was spending his
Christmas leave at home.</p>

<p>Returning from a walk, his mother espied a figure
in the kitchen with the housemaid.</p>

<p>“Clarence,” she called to her son, “Mary’s got
someone in the kitchen. She knows perfectly well that
I don’t allow followers. I wish you’d go and tell the
man to leave the house at once.”</p>

<p>Clarence duly departed to the kitchen, but returned
in about half a minute.</p>

<p>“Sorry, mother, but I can’t turn him out.”</p>

<p>“Can’t turn him out? Why on earth not?”</p>

<p>“He’s my sergeant!”</p>


<h2>SURPRISE FOR THE GERMANS</h2>

<p>It was during the nerve racking period of waiting
for the signal to attack that a seasoned old sergeant
noticed a young soldier fresh from home visibly
affected by the nearness of the coming fight. His face
was pale, his teeth chattered, and his knees tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
touch each other. It was sheer nervousness, but the
sergeant thought it was sheer funk.</p>

<p>“Tompkins,” he said, “is it trembling you are for
your skin?”</p>

<p>“No, no, sergeant,” said he, making a brave attempt
to still his limbs. “I’m trembling for the Germans—they
don’t know I’m here.”</p>


<h2>NO LEAD PIPE CINCH</h2>

<p>“Conscription has, maybe, saved the country,”
growled the soldier, “but what I object to is the
company it drives a man into. I’m a plumber by
trade, an honest workman, yet I’m compelled to
suffer the society of such professionals as a lawyer,
a minister, and an auctioneer.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad selection, Jock,” remarked his friend.</p>

<p>“O, maybe no in a way; but when the minister
and the lawyer start an argument on Egyptian law
in the middle o’ the nicht across half a dozen beds,
wi’ the blessed auctioneer as umpire, what chance
has even a plumber of stopping the gas leak?”</p>


<h2>SERVED HIM RIGHT!</h2>

<p>A professor at Princeton who has taken much interest
in the woman suffrage movement was persuaded
to carry a banner in a wartime parade held in
Washington.</p>

<p>His wife observed him marching with a dejected
air and carrying his banner so that it hung limply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on its standard, and later she reproved him for not
making a better appearance.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you march like somebody, and let
the people see your banner?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Dearie,” sighed the professor, “did you see what
was on that banner? It read, ‘Any man can vote.
Why can’t I?’”</p>


<h2>QUITE A CONTRAST</h2>

<p>It’s all a matter of comparison, according to H. T.
Webster, the cartoonist, who told the following as
proof at a race meeting of the Salmagundi Club:</p>

<p>“Shrapnel shrieked all about. Bombs dropped
from the sky, and every so often a big German shell
burst overhead. Suddenly one Yank burst into a
fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“‘S’matter, Buddy?’ his mate asks, fearing that
he had suddenly gone insane.</p>

<p>“‘I was thinkin’, Bill,’ replied the other between
chuckles, ‘of the runt that held me up one night in
Memphis with a 22-caliber revolver.’”</p>


<h2>AND HOLDING IT YET</h2>

<p>Gen. Von Spew sat in his room and studied the
map. Then he rang the bell at his elbow. In came
Dunderkopf, his aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>“Dunderkopf, glance over this map. Do you see
this hill?”</p>

<p>“I do, Excellency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“That hill must be captured. Attend to the matter
and let me know when it is done.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes passed and there was a knock
at the door. Dunderkopf strode in, clicked his heels
together and saluted.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to announce, Excellency, that
the hill has been captured.”</p>

<p>“Already captured! Fine, my son, fine! Who
occupies it?”</p>

<p>“The Americans, Excellency.”</p>


<h2>FOOLING THE COOTIES</h2>

<p>I wrote to my brother in France, who had been in
action, asking if he had acquired “cooties.” His
reply came back, “Yes, indeed, I had cooties. One
is not a regular soldier until he does have them,
but I got rid of mine in this fashion: I sprinkled my
clothes all over with salt, then laid them down on
a river bank. The cooties became very thirsty and
got off the clothes to get a drink, then I pulled
them away quickly. Nine-tenths of the cooties died
from mortification and the other tenth from lonesomeness.”</p>


<h2>THIS IS A MAN</h2>

<p>Edith Wharton, at her flat in Paris, told a war
story.</p>

<p>“The American wounded were being brought in
from the Marne battlefield,” she said, “and a fussy
American woman in a khaki uniform and Sam
Browne belt bent over a stretcher and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Is this case an officer or only a man?’</p>

<p>“The brawny corporal who stood beside the
stretcher gave a grim laugh and said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, lady, he ain’t no officer, but he’s been hit
twice in the innards, both legs is busted, he’s got
bullets in both arms and we dropped him three
times without his lettin’ out a squawk, so I guess
we can call him a man.’”</p>


<h2>WANTED SOMETHING STATIONARY</h2>

<p>On an American transport two days out from
New York:</p>

<p>First Sambo, who is really enjoying the sea, to
his dark companion, who has gone below: “Nigger!
Come on up! We’re passing a ship!”</p>

<p>Voice from below: “I don’t want to see no ship.
You jes’ call me when we’re passing a tree!”</p>


<h2>YET THEY FOUGHT NOBLY</h2>

<p>Two negroes were discussing the possibilities of
being drafted.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t gwine do ’em any good to pick on me,”
said Sam. “Ah certainly ain’t gwine do any fightin’.
Ah ain’t lost nothin’ oveh in France. Ah ain’t got
any quarrel with a-n-ybody, and dey kain’t make me
fight.”</p>

<p>The other pondered over this statement for a moment.
“Yo right,” he said at length; “Uncle Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kain’t make you fight. But he can take you where
de fightin’ is, and after that you kin use you’ own
judgment.”</p>


<h2>PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY</h2>

<p>During the fighting on the Aisne front one American
company pushed out far ahead and lost touch
with the neighboring companies on either side. Their
zeal in chasing the Germans was leading them into
danger of being enfiladed by machine gun fire from
the flanks. A major stormed up to the captain.</p>

<p>“Why the hell don’t you hold your men back?”
he yelled.</p>

<p>“How the hell can I told ’em back when the whole
German army can’t?”</p>


<h2>THE QUICKER THE SOONER</h2>

<p>“Goodness!” gasped the sergeant of the guard,
sticking his head out of the window, “what is the
man playing at?”</p>

<p>Private Murphy, who was on sentry go, was running
as hard as he could from end to end of his beat.</p>

<p>“Hi, Mike!” yelled the noncom, “what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ there’s no trouble at all, at all,” replied
Murphy, panting as he paused in his scurry.</p>

<p>“Then what are you running for?”</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t I on duty here for two hours? I’m
only trying to get me two hours done quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<h2>TRANSPORTS OF JOY</h2>

<p>“Were you happy when you started for France?”</p>

<p>“Happy? We were in transports.”</p>


<h2>WHERE HE IS EXPERT</h2>

<p>“So you’ve joined the Army, Mose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah.”</p>

<p>“What branch of the service are you in?”</p>

<p>“Well, sah. Ah’s in de infantry, but when we
get t’ France Ah’se done asked de captain to put
me on dat night-raid wo’k. Gittin’ into de odder
fellow’s backyard durin’ de night hours is a job dat
ah considers mahs’l particularly experienced at.”</p>


<h2>NO MULES IN THE AIR</h2>

<p>American Soldier: “So you are in the aviation
corps. I thought you enlisted in the cavalry?”</p>

<p>Gentleman of Color: “Ah dun change.”</p>

<p>American Soldier: “What was the reason?”</p>

<p>Gentleman of Color: “Wal, suh, for one thing, an
aeroplane, after it throws yo’ out, very seldom walks
over an’ bites yo’.”</p>


<h2>DEAR LITTLE BOY</h2>

<p>He was probably the smallest “middy” in the
navy, and one evening he was invited to attend a
party in the saloon. He was such a little chap that
the ladies had no idea that he was a midshipman at
all, but took him for somebody’s “dear little boy”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in a Royal Navy all-wool serge. At last one of
them, on whose lap he had been sitting, and who
had just kissed him, asked:</p>

<p>“And how old are you, little dear?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-two,” he said, in a voice like a foghorn.
Then the lady swooned.</p>


<h2>THEN SHE HAD THEM PRESSED</h2>

<p>A seasoned sergeant major recently was horrified
to see a pair of shamelessly baggy trousers appear at
the top of the window in the orderly room at a London
depot. He shouted out what he thought, as they
descended the ladder, and the face of a woman window
cleaner only completed his discomfiture.</p>


<h2>UNUSUAL OFFICER</h2>

<p>An Australian soldier had overstayed his leave.
He knew his Commanding Officer was fed up with
hard-luck excuses, so wired:</p>

<p>“Not sick, nobody dead, got plenty of money,
having a good time. Please wire two days’ extension.”</p>

<p>He got three.</p>


<h2>NOT SERIOUSLY DAMAGED</h2>

<p>Lieut. John Philip Sousa, while organizing military
bands for the navy, was talking to a correspondent
about the submarine danger.</p>

<p>“A friend of mine, a cornet virtuoso,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
“was submarined in the Mediterranean. The English
paper that reported the affair worded it thus:</p>

<p>“‘The famous cornetist, Mr. Hornblower, though
submarined by the Germans in the Mediterranean,
was able to appear at Marseilles the following evening
in four pieces.’”</p>


<h2>ORDERS, BUT NO SALES</h2>

<p>“And what were you in civilian life?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p>“I was a traveling salesman, sir,” replied the recruit.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then. You’ll get plenty of
orders around here.”</p>


<h2>THOSE FOOL QUESTIONS</h2>

<p>“Have you been to France?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Came back last week.”</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder if you saw anything of that
young nephew of mine out there—Smith is his
name?”</p>


<h2>PROUD OF THEIR SOLDIERS</h2>

<p>“Our Joe’s joined the army,” announced Mary
Brown, proudly, “an’ ’e’s gettin’ on fine wiv ’is
drill. In fac’, when ’is regiment passed ’ere the
other day hevery one wot was in it was out of step
’cep’ ’im.”</p>

<p>“O, that’s nuffin,” retorted Tommy Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“When our ’Arry went to the front the captain ’e
shouted: ‘Is Private ’Arry Johnson in the ranks?’
‘Yes,’ sez somebody. ’Then let the war begin,’ sez
he.”</p>


<h2>NOT FLATTERING HIM ANY</h2>

<p>First Soldier (looking at portraits of himself)—Which
do you think is the best, Mike?</p>

<p>Second Soldier—Well, personally I think the one
of you in the gas mask is the best.</p>


<h2>ONLY KIND HE KNEW</h2>

<p>“I’ve just had some good news,” said Bearnstean,
upon meeting his friend Mr. Abrahams. “My son
Solly has got a commission in the Army.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” replied Abrahams, rubbing his hands;
“how much?”</p>


<h2>NOT HIS KIND OF JEWELRY</h2>

<p>Tommy: “Look ’ere, Jack, now you’re for
Blighty, why don’t you make up to Kitty? Go in
and win, mate! Upon my life she’s a regular pearl!”</p>

<p>Jack: “That may be, but I can’t stand the mother
of pearl.”</p>


<h2>MORE DANGEROUS, ALSO</h2>

<p>Corp—Can you think of anything more unmilitary
than putting your hands in your pockets?</p>

<p>Sarg—Sure! Putting your hands in somebody
else’s pockets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h2>SAME IN ALL LANGUAGES</h2>

<p>Jack Tar: “How do you manage to get on so
well with the French girls when you can’t speak
their lingo?”</p>

<p>Soldier: “I’m surprised you’re so slow. Can’t
you kiss a girl without a dictionary?”</p>


<h2>SHE KNEW JIM</h2>

<p>A soldier at the front got short of money, so he
sent home the following letter:</p>

<p>“Dear Mary—We lost a trench this morning, and
we must replace it at any cost, so will you please
send me $25 at once.”</p>

<p>Sad to say he had a wily wife, who sent the following
reply:</p>

<p>“Dear Jim—Sorry, I have not $25 toward replacing
the lost trench, but I enclose two candles to help
you look for it.”</p>


<h2>THEN HE GOT THIRTY DAYS K. P.</h2>

<p>The colonel had ridden his horse to town in the
afternoon, and it was dark when he returned to camp.
Some distance outside the guard line he was challenged
by a voice from the darkness:</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“Colonel,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Dismount, colonel. Advance and be recognized.”</p>

<p>He was certain that there was some mistake, for
no guard was supposed to be posted there. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sentry’s orders are not to be disobeyed, so he grumblingly
dismounted and led his horse forward, inwardly
vowing vengeance against the sergeant of
the guard who had caused him all this trouble.</p>

<p>As he approached the sentry he burst out wrathfully:</p>

<p>“Who in thunder posted you here?”</p>

<p>“No one, sir. I’m just practicing.”</p>


<h2>PLEASED IS NO NAME FOR IT</h2>

<p>Doris: “Was your C. O. pleased, Algy, when you
told him my idea for beating the Germans on the
Western Front?”</p>

<p>Algy: “Pleased! I should jolly well think he
was. Why, he laughed for hours!”</p>


<h2>GENUINE CHICKEN DINNER</h2>

<p>Two rookies were indulging in the soldier’s privilege—growling
about his station and how the soldier
gets stung for everything.</p>

<p>“I ordered a chicken dinner at a cafe downtown
and they charged me a dollar and six bits,” Bone
was saying.</p>

<p>A newsie overheard him. “Say, mister,” he said,
“I know where you can get a chicken dinner for two
bits. A good big one, too.”</p>

<p>The soldiers looked skeptical, but the newsie insisted
that he was telling the truth. Finally the soldier
who had been stung asked him where this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was located. The newsie mentioned an address on
one of the side streets of San Antonio.</p>

<p>A few days later the two soldiers went to the city
and determined to visit the cheap restaurant. They
found the address. It was a feed store.</p>


<h2>ON THE ORIGINAL FIRING LINE</h2>

<p>Moses and Aaron were partners in business when
Aaron was called up and had to go to camp. About
a month after Aaron had departed he received a
telegram from Moses. The telegram read:</p>

<p>“Business burned out. Got $10,000 insurance.
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Aaron immediately wired back:</p>

<p>“Start another business.”</p>

<p>One month later Aaron received another telegram
from Moses:</p>

<p>“Business burned out again. Got $13,000 insurance.
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Aaron immediately wired back:</p>

<p>“Keep the home fires burning.”</p>


<h2>PLAY THE GAME</h2>

<p>The German artillery were doing their best to
erase a small town from the map. Every few minutes
there would be a deafening crash and the remains
of a house would soar skyward enveloped in
a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>In a field on the outskirts of the town some Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
soldiers, relieved from the trenches for a few
days, were indulging in their favorite game of baseball.
The pitcher had just pitched the ball and
the batsman had hit an easy catch to one of the
fielders when a huge shell landed in the adjoining
field. The fielder’s attention was fixed on the shell,
which burst with a deafening crash, and he missed
the catch.</p>

<p>“For the love of Mike,” roared the pitcher, who
was a typical Irish-Canadian, “if you are going to
play baseball, play baseball, and quit watching the
shells.”</p>


<h2>SHE WAS USED TO IT</h2>

<p>Mrs. Flatbush—So your husband is “somewhere
in France”?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensonhurst—So I believe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flatbush—But don’t you know where?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensonhurst—No.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flatbush—Don’t you feel somewhat concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bensonhurst—Why, no. When he was here
I knew he was somewhere in America, but half of
the time I didn’t know where.</p>


<h2>SPIRIT OF FRANCE</h2>

<p>A tired and dusty doughboy drew up in front of
a shell-battered house in Château-Thierry and
asked a French woman if he could get a drink of
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oui, mon garcon,” said the woman. “You come
right along with me.”</p>

<p>After the soldier had obtained his drink and was
about to depart, he remarked that her house had
suffered more or less from the guns.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “I used it as a dressing
station for the Americans who were wounded here,
and the Boche seemed to know about it. But it’s
all right. We will build it up again and everything
will be the same.”</p>

<p>She explained in detail just how she would rearrange
the architecture, how the windows would be
built larger.</p>

<p>“We will have to carry a lot of rock,” she smiled.
“You see, those are all shot to pieces. But it’s not
far to the river.”</p>

<p>Then she turned and resumed her task of clearing
away the debris that had once been the east wall of
her house.</p>


<h2>RECOGNIZED THE RESEMBLANCE</h2>

<p>Pat was serving in the Army, and his two companions
happened to be an Englishman and a
Scotsman. These two gave their Irish friend a lively
time with their jokes and teasing.</p>

<p>One day Pat was called away, and left his coat
hanging on a nail. The Englishman and Scotsman,
seeing some white paint near, seized the opportunity
of painting a donkey’s head on the back of Pat’s
coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter soon returned, and looking first at his
coat, and then fixing his eye on his chums, said
slowly: “Begorra! and which of you two has wiped
your face on my coat?”</p>


<h2>PROOF POSITIVE</h2>

<p>“Come, corporal,” said the colonel, “say definitely
what you mean. Was the prisoner drunk, or wasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“’E wasn’t himself, sir; he was under the influence
of drink. When I saw him he’d been washing his
face in a puddle an’ he was trying to wipe it on a
wire doormat, cursin’ the holes in the ‘towel.’”</p>


<h2>CAN SHOW WHAT HE’S GOOD FOR</h2>

<p>The sergeant-major had trouble in finding an
accountant for his captain, but at last brought in
a private for trial.</p>

<p>“Are you a clerk?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about figures?” asked
the captain.</p>

<p>“I can do a bit,” replied the man, modestly.</p>

<p>“Is this the best man you can find?” asked the
officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well,” growled the captain, “I suppose I’ll have
to put up with him!” Turning to the private, he
snapped, “What were you in civilian life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Professor of mathematics at the State College,
sir,” was the unexpected reply.</p>


<h2>GLAD HE TALKED TO GEN. PERSHING</h2>

<p>He was in khaki, but it’s better not to say what
branch of the service he is in, and it certainly would
be cruel to hint at his company. There are probably
gold bars in it, and the guardhouse is not the place
for a returned soldier. Here’s the story he tells. He
says it’s true:</p>

<p>“Sometimes overseas,” he said, “it seems as if
every other man you met was a second lieutenant.</p>

<p>“One day last spring Gen. Pershing and his staff
found themselves out in the open with a chance for a
bit of rest, the first in days, but nary a place to take
it in.</p>

<p>“Well, ‘Black Jack’ thought what was good
enough for his men wasn’t so worse for him. He
just quietly rolled himself up in his cape and lay
down under a hedge where the mud wasn’t more
than a foot deep, and the staff took the next hedge
and did likewise.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon along comes a regiment and stops
for a minute. Some of the men drop out for a
snooze, and one of them comes along to the hedge
which was ‘Black Jack’s’ private ‘boodoir’ and lies
down beside him. Pretty soon he begins to talk to
the chief friendly like, and Pershing talks to him
and it was mighty dark.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon the regiment’s ordered to fall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and the Johnny leaves ‘Black Jack’ casual like and
starts to rejoin. But on his way he meets an orderly
and he asks him, ‘Who’s that decent guy under the
hedge?’</p>

<p>“‘My gracious,’ or words to that effect, as they
say at the court-martials, remarks the orderly, ‘Don’t
you know that’s General Pershing?’</p>

<p>“Well, that soldier does some tall thinking for a
minute and then he goes back to the hedge and stands
at salute and begs Pershing’s pardon most pretty.
The General looks up at him and our friend swears
he was grinning a little and he says slow and thoughtful
like:</p>

<p>“‘Never mind. That was an interesting talk and
I understand. It’s all right with me, but,’ and the
eyes of him looked as sober as if he was talking tactics
with Foch, ‘Don’t try it with any of those new
second lieutenants.’</p>

<p>“And,” concluded the man in khaki, “the guy
went away just a-shuddering with thinking what
would have happened if it had been a second lieutenant
instead of just a General.”</p>


<h2>BEFORE ONE CAN TURN AROUND</h2>

<p>Willis—How do you like army life? Quite a number
of new turns for a fellow to get used to, I suppose.</p>

<p>Gillis—You bet. At night you turn in, and just
as you are about to turn over somebody turns up
and says, “Turn out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h2>ONE ON THE COLONEL</h2>

<p>The Colonel beckoned to his orderly.</p>

<p>“Smith, I wish you’d ride into the town and get
the correct time.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” Smith hesitated, “I haven’t got a
watch.”</p>

<p>“A watch, a watch,” the Colonel roared. “What
in the name of sense do you want a watch for? Write
it down on a piece of paper, man.”</p>


<h2>A GRAND STAND PLAY</h2>

<p>All sorts of stories come from across the water
relative to misunderstandings between Yanks and the
ladies over there, and not the least amusing is one
told at the Washington Press Club by one of the
correspondents.</p>

<p>Seems the doughboy had taken an English girl to
a baseball game, and, after it was over, was eager
to make sure that she had understood and appreciated
the great American game.</p>

<p>“Now, if there’s anything you didn’t understand
tell me and I’ll explain,” he pleaded in her fair ear.</p>

<p>“Well,” she answered, “really, don’t you know, I
didn’t understand a bit of it, and some of it sounded
awfully silly.”</p>

<p>“What was so awfully silly?” demanded the doughboy.
“Tell me and I’ll explain.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the girl, dubiously, “why do they
call the seats the stands?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>And, at last reports, the soldier was still trying
to tell her.</p>


<h2>THE NEGRO IN AUTHORITY</h2>

<p>Camp Devens, Mass.—These colored noncommissioned
officers are efficient or nothing.</p>

<p>A newly-made corporal, recently from Dixie, was
superintending the breaking up of some old cases
down in the 13th Battalion today. A dark recruit
was wielding an ax with vigor and with fair success.
The corporal apparently couldn’t find any specific
thing the matter with his work, but he stopped him
just the same. “Boy,” said the dignified corporal,
“boy, does you know how to do dis yere work?”</p>

<p>“Co’se ah does,” replied the recruit rather indignantly.</p>

<p>The corporal eyed him dangerously. “Sojer,”
he said, darkly, “did ah evah show you how dis should
be done? Have yo’ evah received any constructions
fum me?”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted the rookie reluctantly, “yo’ nevah
tol’ me nuthin’.”</p>

<p>“Den, man, yo’ don’ know nuthin’,” exploded the
corporal, and the private meekly dropped his ax.</p>


<h2>DON’T YOU DO IT, TOMMY</h2>

<p>Old Lady (to severely wounded soldier): “Poor
man, have you lost your leg?”</p>

<p>Tommy: “Yes, mum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Lady: “Oh, poor fellow! Do have an apple!”</p>

<p>Tommy (to his chum, when the old lady had departed):
“Bill, I think I’ll have my other leg off
before she comes next week. I might get a banana!”</p>


<h2>NO PROHIBITION THERE</h2>

<p>“That’s how we do things in the Army,” said
Tommy, pointing to a news heading which bore the
word, “Five Hundred Germans Drowned in Champagne.”
“Got nothing to beat that in the Navy,
I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, haven’t we?” retorted his sailor friend. “My
lad, that’s nothing to get excited about—nothing
at all. In that last little affair along the Belgian
coast we sank three German submarines in port!”</p>


<h2>CHAFFING EACH OTHER</h2>

<p>When Charles Schwab was inspecting the Seattle
shipbuilding yards he was accompanied by his friend,
Dr. Eaton. Both are eloquent speakers, the crowd
always calling for more. It was horse and horse
between the two as to which could tell the most impossible
story on the other.</p>

<p>One day while addressing a few thousand shipbuilders,
Dr. Eaton scored a base hit with this:</p>

<p>“Boys, I’ll tell you something in strict confidence.
A few days ago when in Tacoma, Charlie and I
went aboard a new ship that was nearly ready to go
in service. As we walked along the clean, new deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Charlie noticed some large lids and wondered what
was inside. So the sailors came and lifted the hatch,
and when he looked down into the hold he said, ‘Why,
the damn thing is hollow!’”</p>

<p>Then Charlie came to bat and told how on leaving
Portland “Doc” rushed to him in great excitement
with the announcement that he had lost his baggage.</p>

<p>“‘It’s too bad,’ I said. ‘How did it happen?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, the cork came out,’ moaned the Doctor.”</p>


<h2>GETTING ON FAST</h2>

<p>One day in a French village two soldiers were
being served coffee by an old French woman when
one of them remarked, “Gee, Bill, this don’t taste
like coffee.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t,” answered his companion; “it’s chicory.”</p>

<p>The first soldier looked at him in admiration and
said: “Here we only struck this place yesterday
and you’re learning the language already.”</p>


<h2>NO WONDER HE REBELLED</h2>

<p>The Officer (to recruit reported for insubordination,
who has refused to enter the swimming pool)—And
what have you got to say for yourself?</p>

<p>Recruit—Please, sir, I’ve only been in the navy
three days. The first day the doctor drawed two
o’ me teeth; the second day I was vaccinated, and
now a petty orficer, he says, “Come along! We’re
goin’ ter drown yer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<h2>THEY ALL GET ’EM</h2>

<p>Bill is a soldier in France. Several months ago his
sweetheart, Dolly, sent him a box of fruit, nuts, etc.
Two weeks later she sent a letter and incidentally
asked him if he got the goodies. She evidently didn’t
write distinctly or Bill didn’t read carefully. To her
surprise she received a letter from him saying: “Yes,
every soldier gets the cooties.” So much alike, yet
so different.</p>


<h2>REACHED HIS LIMIT</h2>

<p>After coming in from a 20-mile “hike” the officer
in command of a negro company said, before dismissing
them: “I want all the men who are too tired
to take another hike to take two paces forward.”</p>

<p>All stepped forward except one big, husky six-footer.
Noticing him, the officer said: “Well, Johnson,
ready for twenty miles more?”</p>

<p>“No, sah,” replied Johnson. “Ah’m too tired
to even take dem two steps.”</p>


<h2>SEEKING INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Sambo, a dusky warrior in the American army,
had only recently landed, and was comparing London
with New York. He paused before a shop window
full of watches. His gaze became fixed on a very
shiny watch on a velvet cushion, on which was pinned
a card bearing the words, “This watch will go for
eight days without winding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Sambo pondered, and then walked straight into
the shop: “Say, boss, will you tell how long dat
darn watch will go if you do wind it up?”</p>


<h2>BIRDS FAR SURPASSED</h2>

<p>“Look at that fellow doing the ‘falling leaf,’ the
‘tail spin,’ and other fancy tricks away up there in
the air.”</p>

<p>“I see him.”</p>

<p>“I never thought I’d live to see a man as much
at home in the air as a bird.”</p>

<p>“Umph! No bird is in the same class with an
expert aviator when it comes to flying. Did you
ever see a bird that could fly upside down?”</p>


<h2>NO KICK COMING</h2>

<p>Camp Devens, Mass.—Seven hundred and fifty
medical replacement troops have just left this camp
for service overseas. Just before their departure
a sergeant from the Depot Brigade came to Lieut.-Col.
C. C. McCornack, Division Surgeon, and asked
for a transfer to the detachment then about to leave.</p>

<p>“Colonel,” he pleaded, “I’ve been in this doggone
army more than a year. In that time I’ve scarcely
set foot outside this camp. If I don’t get across
now, I never will. I’ll be a hell of a soldier, won’t I?”</p>

<p>Col. McCornack leaned back in his chair and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” he said, “you’ve got a fine chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
getting any sympathy out of me on that score. I’ve
been in the Army twenty years and haven’t got
across. What are you kicking about?”</p>


<h2>A REAL SPREE</h2>

<p>The Liberty Bond squad had some interesting experiences.
“I am not subscribing for this $50 Liberty
Bond to please you,” explained a woman, as
doleful as she is wealthy. “I am doing it to please
my own self.”</p>

<p>“Make it $100,” said the young solicitor, “and
give yourself one roaring, rousing good time.”</p>


<h2>MOVING PICTURE IN ONE REEL</h2>

<p>The chaplain of a certain camp was challenged
by a sentry with, “Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>The minister answered, “Chaplain.”</p>

<p>“Advance, Charlie,” ordered the sentry, “and be
recognized.” For which he was banished to the
guardroom.</p>


<h2>USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL</h2>

<p>The flappers were taken out to tea by two staff
officers resplendent in scarlet and khaki. Being “on
the staff” caused the two young men to be very popular
with themselves, and to treat the flappers rather
patronizingly. The younger of the two girls was
lost in admiration. Looking up her escort adoringly,
she cooed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“O, what lovely boots! And spurs, too! Why
do you wear spurs?”</p>

<p>“O,” chipped in the other girl, who objected to
being regarded as an infant, “the spurs are to keep
the feet from slipping off their office stools!”</p>


<h2>THE MILITARY HAIR CUT</h2>

<p>A grizzled chap in a captain’s uniform came into
a barber shop. He saluted smartly and seated himself
in the chair.</p>

<p>“Hair cut,” he said in gruff tones.</p>

<p>“How would you like it cut, sir?” the barber asked.</p>

<p>The captain, who was baldish, answered, gruffer
than ever:</p>

<p>“Line up the hairs and number off to the right.
Odd numbers each want a half inch off. Dress
smartly with bay rum and brilliantine. Then dismiss.”</p>


<h2>BASEBALL IN BLIGHTY</h2>

<p>An American officer recently expressed his surprise
that English people had so quickly appreciated
the fascinations of baseball, and particularly how
very enthusiastic women were on the game.</p>

<p>“Why, at the Navy and Army match the other
week,” he said, “I counted quite twenty ‘fans’ among
the women sitting around me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said a charming old lady, “and I wished
I had taken mine, for the heat was terribly trying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>


<h2>UNIVERSAL COMPLAINT</h2>

<p>An American soldier was being shown over an
old English church where hundreds of people were
buried.</p>

<p>“A great many people sleep between these walls,”
said the guide, indicating the inscription-covered
floor.</p>

<p>“So?” said the doughboy. “Same way over in
our country. Why don’t you get a more interesting
preacher?”</p>


<h2>SAMPLE WAS SATISFACTORY</h2>

<p>It was a hot day, and two sailors had just been
released from a long spell of duty on a mine sweeper.
They made a bee-line for the first public-house they
saw, and one of them ordered two quarts of ale.
The men emptied their mugs in one draught whilst
the barmaid looked on in undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>The man who had paid stood for a second or two
wetting his lips meditatively, and then turned to his
comrade with a grin.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so bad, Bill, is it?” he remarked. “Shall
we ’ave some?”</p>


<h2>NO FUN WITHOUT FUNDS</h2>

<p>A New York editor said on his return from an
official visit to the front:</p>

<p>“The soldier can still have a good time on his
furlough, but the war prices make a good time costly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“A handsome young American officer was sending
a wire one day in a London postoffice where I was
mailing a package. The girl telegraph clerk, running
over the officer’s message said:</p>

<p>“‘I can’t make out whether this reads ”No funds“
or ”No fun.“’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, well, what’s the difference?’ said the officer,
gloomily lighting a cigarette.”</p>


<h2>THOUGHT HE HAD ARRIVED</h2>

<p>One of our transports sailing from an Atlantic
port, heading for France with a load of negro troops,
had engine trouble two days out. It was decided
that the ship put back to port, and it returned, but
to a different pier of that same port.</p>

<p>The dusky warriors were immediately unloaded
and made ready to embark on another ship. While
standing in line, one of the braves stepped out and
walking up to an officer asked:</p>

<p>“Ah beg yo’ pardin, sah, but can you tell me whar
the city of Paris lies fum hyere?”</p>


<h2>“COUNT ’EM NOW, MISTAH KAISER”</h2>

<p>This story was brought back from the trenches
by a Knights of Columbus secretary:</p>

<p>A colored soldier, hearing the report of a 14-inch
naval gun exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There! Mistah Kaiser! You all count your men
now and see how many is missing.”</p>

<p class='center'><br />
<b>160 Pages. &nbsp;&nbsp;Paper Covers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Price 30 cents.</b><br />
<br />

<b>BY CARLETON B. CASE.</b>
<br />—————</p>

<p>(Spring of 1917.) The very newest, largest and
choicest collection of merry quips about our friend
the Ford car, all good-natured and laughable, with
nothing to offend even Mr. Henry Ford himself.
The author went to Detroit and obtained some of
the new jokes in this book right at the Ford factory.
You can’t help laughing, whether you own
a Ford car or not, at the funny things in “Ford
Smiles.” When you get this book of humor we ask
you to read the short Preface to it; it explains, in
the author’s opinion, why every good Ford joke
is a compliment to that great invention—the Ford
Motor Car. Probably you hadn’t thought of it that
way.</p>
